A story in which gods resort to desperate tactics to protect their power and privileges! </em>

       <p>Sravanotsavam  or Onam celebrations coincide with the harvest season of the Malayalees.  &nbsp;There is a plentiful supply of paddy and bananas in abundance in every  home or at least they should have. &nbsp;The saying goes &quot;Kanam Vittum  Onam Unnanam&quot; - it is the best time of rejoicing for the young and the old  alike. &nbsp;Why? For the simple reason that everyone is looking forward to the  arrival of their great benevolent ruler King Mahabali. &nbsp;The weather is  pleasantly sunny. &nbsp;Songs are sung in praise of the deported monarch,  recollecting how during his reign there was happiness everywhere, agriculture  flourished, none had any sickness, vices such as dishonesty and unfaithfulness  were unheard of. &nbsp;In short, it was real Utopia on earth! &nbsp;The ruler  most sympathetic and sacrificial in his nature - living just for the prosperity  and welfare of his people. &nbsp;Anyone in need could approach him and never returned  empty handed. &nbsp;Then how come such a great king was so mercilessly sent  down to the Pathala Loka, literally kicked down and that too by none other than  the great protecting god - Vishnu himself? &nbsp;At this point it would be  interesting to trace the roots further down... whether you call it history or  myth.</p>
       <p>Suras and  Asuras are two sets of beings constantly at war. &nbsp;Interestingly they are  cousins! &nbsp;The Devas or Suras being the sons of Adhithi, and hence known as  Adhithiyas. &nbsp;While the Asuras were born to Dithi, the sister of Adhithi,  came to be known as Daithas - the children of Dithi. &nbsp;There were times  when they all were minding their own affairs and did not fight. &nbsp;As a  matter of fact, in times of need Suras would approach Asuras, their cousins,  for help as in the case of churning of the Milk Ocean... that is another story.  &nbsp;During one such fight, the Devas were utterly defeated by the Asuras.  &nbsp;Headed by their defeated king Devendra, the Suras fled from Swarga Loka.  &nbsp;Mahabali the great Asura king became the mighty ruler of the three worlds  - Bhoomi, Swarga and Pathala. &nbsp;The frustrated Devas had to do something.  &nbsp;They couldn't remain in recluse forever, being beaten was not the end of  the world. &nbsp;They approached the most benevolent god Siva. &nbsp;But to  Siva, Asuras are as dear as Devas and besides, how could Siva ever dream of  hurting that great devotee of his - the illustrious and incomparable Mahabali?  &nbsp;Devendra knew better. &nbsp;He headed towards Vaikundha, the abode of  Vishnu and he consented to help the Devas. &nbsp;Did Vishnu have a softer  corner for Devas? &nbsp;Here one has to remember the part played by the  Devamatha Adhithi. &nbsp;As a mother she was deeply upset at Devendra and his  followers. &nbsp;Following the advice of her husband Kasyapa Prajapathi began  doing penance to Vishnu, the God of protection and he finally appeared before  her. &nbsp;Adhithi had two wishes. &nbsp;Firstly she longed to have Vishnu born  as her son and secondly to restore the lost kingdom to Devendra and Devas by  vanquishing the mighty Asura king Mahabali.</p>
       <p>It was the auspicious  day in the first month of the year, Chingam, when the star was Sravana  (Thiruvonam) and the thithi, Pournami (Full moon) when Vishnu took his fifth  avathar of Vamana or Indranuja (being the younger brother of Devendra) as the  son of Adhithi. &nbsp;Hymns were sung by Rishis and Devas. &nbsp;Adhithi was  fortunate to have a glimpse of the most radiant Vishnu-roopa. &nbsp;Quickly the  figure of Vishnu transformed and there stood a young hermit Vamana, also known  as Vadu- a real Brahmachari.</p>
       <p>Brihaspathi,  the Deva guru presented him with Brahma Sutra, the sacred thread, while his  father Kasyapa gave Vamana his deer skin. &nbsp;Bhoomi Devi gave him Koupeena  (a sort of tight underwear!), Brahma gave a kamandalu (bowl for carrying holy  water) and Vanaspathi, a Chatra (an umbrella made of palm leaves).</p>
       <p>Being fully  equipped as a young hermit Vamana appeared as a young hermit Vamana appeared by  the side of the Yaga Sala of the great Mahabali. &nbsp;Hearing about the most  radiant Brahmachari, Mahabali rushed out to welcome him carrying Arghya and  Padya (water for purifying face and feet). With folded hands Mahabali spoke to  his honoured guest “O, Holy one, now I know that my Yaga is satisfactorily  fulfilled, I am happy. &nbsp;The prosperity of my subjects is assured.”  &nbsp;He requested the holy visitor to tell him all about himself and in  particular the purpose of his visit. &nbsp;“It is my honoured duty and joy to  fulfil it, O, blessed sir, just tell me what you wish.” &nbsp;With a serene  smile Vamana bowed to Mahabali and said, “I am a lone hermit as you can see,  wandering in search of a small plot of land where I could live and meditate.  &nbsp;Hearing about your generosity and greatness I have come to you.  &nbsp;Every where one hears only your praise, O, mighty king,” said Vamana.</p>
       <p>Replied  Mahabali, who was a grandson of Asura ruler Prahlada, one of greatest devotees  of Vishnu, “O, noble sir, all that I am eager to hear is in what way could I  help you. &nbsp;Please don't hesitate, is it wealth, or precious gems and gold  or a royal residence? &nbsp;For that matter I would be the happiest man if you  would reside in my palace, eternally or again could it be you need a vast area,  a portion of my kingdom?&quot; &nbsp;Again the serene smile giving added  radiance to his handsome face.</p>
       <p>“My King,” he  began, “your generosity is, as I have heard, incomparable. &nbsp;But my  requirement is trifle. &nbsp;Can I have a space measuring three steps? &nbsp;A  plot I could measure with my foot. &nbsp;I just want to do meditation in a  secluded spot.”</p>
       <p>The great ruler  could not help smiling, being amused. &nbsp;“Sir, forget it. &nbsp;What would  you do in such a tiny spot? &nbsp;Do accept a vast area in any part of my  kingdom. &nbsp;This is a promise? &nbsp;But Vamana was adamant. &nbsp;“I told  you, O, King, that is just the space I need.”</p>
       <p>Hearing the  final word of his esteemed guest, Mahabali had no choice other than ordering  his Bringarakam to be brought - the bowl with a spout containing holy water or  theertha. &nbsp;Once the theertha is poured into the folded palms of the needy,  it is understood that his or her wish stands fulfilled. &nbsp;Sukracharya, the  Kula Guru (guru of the clan) of the Asuras, who had all along been a silent  witness to this drama, could no longer remain passive. &nbsp;The saint had  known from the very start the identity of the Vadu.</p>
       <p>“O, my  unsuspecting King, Sukracharya whispered in the king's ear, &quot;this is no  ordinary Brahmachari! &nbsp;Do you not see the radiance of his face and form?  &nbsp;He is Vishnu who has come in disguise to protect the Devas. &nbsp;Please,  please don't make any promise. &nbsp;He is here to destroy you and your  kingdom.”</p>
       <p>The words of  the guru fell on deaf ears. &nbsp;Had not the great King already given his  word? &nbsp;How could truth be defied? &nbsp;Never. &nbsp;To him truth was  above everything. &nbsp;Un-perturbed Mahabali declared, “If that is His will, I  bow to it.”</p>
       <p>With these  words the noble king proceeded with his duty. &nbsp;Sukracharya could not bear  to see his beloved king ending up a recluse. &nbsp;In a desperate attempt to  save his king, the Guru changed himself into a small hard object and stationed  himself in the spout of the Bringarakam, intending to block the flow of  theertha into the folded hands of Vamana. &nbsp;Quickly Vamana thrust the sharp  end of darbha grass into the spout and lo! &nbsp;Poor Sukracharya lost one of  his eyes and in pain he moved out! &nbsp;The great ruler had just one thought,  fulfilling his word to Vamana and retaining one's honesty. &nbsp;The hard  object was no longer in the path, holy water flowed easily into Vamana's hands.  &nbsp;The next moment a gigantic form stood in the place of the youthful  hermit. &nbsp;With one foot, the earth was measured, with the other, the swarga  loka. &nbsp;Where was the space to place his foot for a third measuring?  &nbsp;Seeing Vamana's raised foot the great Mahabali said, &quot;O, Lord, I  understand everything. &nbsp;All that is left as mine is just this body.  &nbsp;Place your foot on my head and bless me, so that I am able to keep my  word.&quot; &nbsp;Removing his crown, the incomparable monarch folded his hands  in prayer and bowed his head. &nbsp;In a flash then appeared king Prahlada on  the scene to reassure his grandson Mahabali. &nbsp;Vamana blessed both Mahabali  and his grandfather Prahlada as they slowly disappeared into Pathala.  &nbsp;Prahlada thus witnessed one more Avathar of Vishnu!</p>
       <p>As he was  leaving behind everything of his, the great Mahabali had one request to make to  Vishnu. &nbsp;“O, Lord, I love my people and they love me. &nbsp;Enable me to  see them all happy and contended once every year.&quot; &nbsp;The wish was  granted. &nbsp;The day Mahabali makes his visit every year is Sravana or  Thiruvonam and people celebrate the day singing the praise of their beloved  ruler, &quot;Long live Maveli, the bringer of peace and happiness.”</p>
       <p>Sravanotsavam  reflects the joy and contentment of the harvest season. &nbsp;The fields  glowing with golden paddy grains and fruits and flowers in abundance. &nbsp;The  month is Chingam, the first month of the year. &nbsp;The weather is pleasantly  warm. &nbsp;Onam celebrations begin with the day when the star is Atham  (Hastha) and continues with increasing enthusiasm and excitement to Thiruvonam  (Sravana) day. &nbsp;On this auspicious day, the most benevolent king of  Kerala, Maveli comes from Pathala (underworld) to ensure that his subjects are  as happy as they were during his reign. &nbsp;It is a time for rejoicing for  the young and old, for the rich and poor, for isn't the King visiting each  house and isn't the whole land one big family just waiting eagerly to welcome  him?</p>
       <p>The rising sun  witnesses a lovely floral decoration in the porch of every single house.  &nbsp;It is the sole right of the adolescent girls, the making of the Pookkalam  in lovely designs with of course young boys helping them, mainly to gather flowers  the previous evening. &nbsp;The most significant flower is that of the tiny  Thumba plant (Lucas Aspera) and the flowers are equally tiny though they  glitter in the soft rays of the sun. &nbsp;It is because “Thumba Poo” is a  favourite flower of Siva, and coming to think of it wasn't the great Mahabali a  pious devotee of Siva as well!</p>
       <p>An early bath  and visit to the temple is a must and receiving the holy theertham and fragrant  sandalwood paste and Thulasi leaves as prasadam. &nbsp;In a buoyant atmosphere  they plan the day, while at breakfast from Atham onwards the food is mainly  steamed bananas with fried pappadam. &nbsp;Interestingly none feels enough is  enough when the same food is served up to Thiruvonam. &nbsp;A swing would be  then hung for the younger ones, while the adolescent girls and women gather in  the hall after lunch for the traditional folk dance of Kerala namely  Kaikottikkali (as it involves a lot of clapping of the hands). &nbsp;Men might  watch it or they could have their ways of entertainment like Thalapanthu or less  vigorous indoor games such as Chathurangam (Chess). &nbsp;Things vary a little  in Namboodiri homes where men are not allowed to watch the activities of  ladies. &nbsp;Either way it is a superb time of enjoyment for women and  adolescent girls. &nbsp;All participate - young and old, maid or mistress.  &nbsp;There would be a feeling of unity and co-operation, the leading lady  guiding the others.<br />
         <br />
         I particularly  remember one visit to the neighbouring illam (House of Namboodri). &nbsp;Most  women gather there after lunch as the women of that illam were proficient in  singing and dancing. &nbsp;I can still visualise that dainty elderly Namboodiri  lady leading the singing in a sweet voice. &nbsp;She was describing the  bewilderment and agony of the Gopikas not seeing their Krishna in their midst  in Vrindavana - asking each flower and plant if any of them saw Krishna, “Mulla  mallike nalla malathi malla lochane undo kandu?” &nbsp;Invariably songs are  sung in praise of the great ruler Mahabali as well.<br />
         <br />
         The festival  gains importance acquiring a holy aura as Thiruvonam approaches. &nbsp;On the  day prior to Thiruvonam - the Utradam (Uttarashada) a sanctified area, either  at the entrance of the house or just within the house is decorated in  traditional design with loose rice paste. &nbsp;An earthen or wooden Thrikkakkara  appan or Mathevar (short for Mahadeva, Siva) is installed on a peedham with his  sons, the rice paste decorating those forms as well. &nbsp;A senior male and a  young boy assisting him wearing new clothes after his bath starts the pooja,  lighting the bronze lamps to convince the arriving Maveli of the plentiful  ness. &nbsp;Then there is Nira para (the huge measuring vessel with paddy  heaped in it) on one side with pookkula (the inflorescence of the coconut  palm). &nbsp;All members of the family including the servants remain watching  the pooja and praying. &nbsp;After the pooja is over each applies the  sandalwood paste on the forehead and flowers go in the hair and they share the  eatables - Ada, Avil,.bananas etc. as prasadam, a sort of starter for the  sumptuous breakfast to follow. &nbsp;The lunch is equally grand, food being  served on banana leaves. &nbsp;One banana leaf with food is kept near the lit  bronze lamp for Maveli, for isn't all this preparations mainly to welcome him?</p>
       <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
       </p>
       <p>Kaikottikkali  is on an elaborate scale, everyone is jubilant. &nbsp;Dressed in the  traditional gold-bordered mundu and Neriyathu with a lit bronze lamp in the  centre of the circle. &nbsp;Could there be a more jubilant day, full of joy and  buoyancy! &nbsp;With that sense of oneness with everyone and with Nature!  &nbsp;This is the supreme moment when that august, ever- benevolent king of  ours is with us, at last! &nbsp;And the song echoes everywhere:</p>
       <p>“Maveli Nadu  Vaneedum Kalam &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manusharellarum onnu pole…”</p>
       <p>Coming back to  the old story of august king Mahabali, whether myth or history, doubtless it  adds a new zest in everyone's life, incites one to follow the good old ideals  in life, developing broad-mindedness and being inspired by the dedication the  great ruler showed.</p>
       <p>Along with the  poet, one could joyfully sing:</p>
       <p>“Vaninnevam  asuya &nbsp;valarthi &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vazka maveli  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mangalamoorthy..”</p>
       <p>Long live  Maveli, purveyor of peace and prosperity, inciting jealousy in the heavenly  beings!</p>
       <p>Did you know?</p>
       <p>In a book  titled Keralolpathi Kappana Krishna Menon narrates how the people of Kerala are  in reality the descendants of a race that inhabited the mystery-shrouded Indus  Valley. &nbsp;When the area was escavated, researchers discovered that people  who lived there were of Dravidian origin, had tolerably good living conditions,  well constructed houses with proper drainage system and a language of their  own. &nbsp;How such a civilisation came to an abrupt end remains a mystery.  &nbsp;According to the author, their rulers were totally dedicated to the  welfare of their subjects and that there was great prosperity until the last  ruler was either slain or vanquished by the invading Aryans. &nbsp;Leaving all  their possessions, the people migrated southward and finally settled in the far  end of the west coast. &nbsp;With the High Ranges of the western ghats on one  side and the formidable sea on the other, life must have appeared safe.  &nbsp;They loved their most benevolent ruler so much that they continued to  cherish his memory, each taking a vow to lead a highly simple life, never  wearing coloured clothes, bathing first thing in the morning, visiting temples  with white wet clothes on and praying and praying for the return of their king  sometime... in a rebirth?! &nbsp;The habit continues to the day. &nbsp;Is it  that the vanquished ruler is identified as Mahabali? &nbsp;Or could it be that  both are one and the same being? &nbsp;However that may be, the fact remains  that we the Keralites are so very different from rest of Bharat in our ways of  life.</p>
       <p>In the first  place, think of our Onam celebrations. &nbsp;It is also the beginning of our  New Year (Kolla varsham). &nbsp;We celebrate the first month of the year,  Chingam (August - September), when the sun is in Leo of the zodiac sign (Simha  rasi), which happens to be the sun's house as well. &nbsp;People of other  states have their New Year at a time when the sun enters the zodiac sign Aries  (Mesha rasi which is sun's house of exaltation (April - May), a few months  earlier. &nbsp;But don't we celebrate that day as well? &nbsp;Yes we do, but In  our own characteristic way. &nbsp;With Vishukkani (the first object one sets  eyes on waking up; usually a huge flat bronze vessel with gold or other coins,  fruits, vegetables, a picture of Krishna, a small mirror, coconut leaves and  plenty of golden Konna flowers on either side) and everyone wears brand new  clothes and youngsters receive Vishu Kai Neettam, a gift, a silver coin  generally. &nbsp;Deepavali is a grand affair with hundreds of tiny lamps lit  throughout India. &nbsp;But in Kerala, though we know about its origin etc.,  the celebration part is left to others! &nbsp;In earlier days, epics like  Ramayana and Maha Bhagavatha would be read by a senior lady of the family and  the story explained to the listening youngsters by a second lady. &nbsp;Could  it be the reason for the people of Kerala being the most educated among  Indians? &nbsp;Does that account for the words of none other than Swami  Vivekananda, “I bow to you, women of Kerala”. &nbsp;The occasion was in the fag  end of the last century when Swami visited Calicut. &nbsp;He was not only one  of the greatest of our spiritual leaders but one who was highly interested in  the education of women in particular. &nbsp;He rightly claimed, “an educated  mother means an educated family”. &nbsp;Swami wanted to have a dialogue with a  Kerala woman. &nbsp;But them wasn't one woman who spoke English. &nbsp;So Swami  queried, &nbsp;“Could there be one lady who could converse in Sanskrit?”  &nbsp;Indeed there were some and Swami desired to have a fifteen minute talk.  &nbsp;But the talk or dialogue continued lasting more than an hour and  Vivekananda was impressed by their knowledge.</p>
