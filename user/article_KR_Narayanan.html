       <p><img style="padding:10px;" src="images/article_KR_Narayanan_clip_image002.jpg" alt="RK Narayanan" width="185" height="242" align="left" /> </p>
       <p>Malayalees all  over the world felt proud when Sri K. R. Narayanan was elected as the seventh  President of India, the highest elected office in the country, in June 1997.  &nbsp;A closer look at the personality and background of Sri Narayanan would  only increase our admiration for him, particularly because of the low profile  he maintained throughout his years in public service.</p>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>
       <p>Kocheril Raman  Narayanan was born at Uzhavoor in Central Kerala on 27 th October 1920 as the  fourth of the seven children of Raman Vaidyan, a dalit traditional medical  practitioner. &nbsp;Like many families of the time, Narayanan's family  experienced extreme social (due to the caste system) and economic hardship.  &nbsp;In spite of this, his family was keen on ensuring best possible education  to young Narayanan from the age of four. &nbsp;However, limited economic means  meant that he had to go through personal difficulties during his school days,  like walking 10 miles every day to school and later to the CMS college in  Kottayam. &nbsp;Many a time he had to face embarrassing situation for late  payment of fees, until he obtained merit scholarship from the intermediate  level (11+) and passed the BA (Literature) Honours examination from the  Maharaja's College, Thiruvananthapuram. &nbsp;He won the first rank in the  University of Travancore.</p>
       <p>The university  denied him a chance to work as a lecturer, which he well merited and  desperately wanted, simply because he hailed from a backward community.  &nbsp;Instead the authorities offered him the job of a clerk, which he did not  accept. &nbsp;In protest, he refused to accept his degree. &nbsp;Fifty years  later, when he had become the Vice President of India, the same university  requested him to accept the degree, which he gracefully accepted. &nbsp;It was  then revealed by the University’s vice - chancellor that Narayanan had been the  only student to score 60 percent in the BA Honours examination of 1943, which  was a rare achievement in those days. &nbsp;Perhaps that was the first of the  many firsts for which Narayanan would be known and respected by the world.</p>
       <p>After  unsuccessful attempts to become a full time teacher, Narayanan left for Delhi  to try and become journalist. &nbsp;After a month as an assistant at the Indian  Overseas Department in Delhi, he quit and joined the Economic Weekly for  Commerce and Industry as journalist, as journalism was his passion. &nbsp;While  working there he wrote to J. R. D. Tata, the industrialist, seeking the  scholarship that eventually took him to the London School of Economics.  &nbsp;As a journalist, he sought and got a cherished interview with Mahatma  Gandhi.</p>
       <p>On return from  London, Narayanan was inducted to the prestigious Indian Foreign Service, and  represented India as a diplomat in many important world capitals. &nbsp;While  posted in Burma, he met Mark Twint, his future wife who later changed her name  to Usha. &nbsp;He has the distinction to have been India's ambassador in the  Soviet Union, China and the United States of America - last posting ending in  1984 - countries with which India's equation was very critical due to geo -  political alliances.</p>
       <p>It was only  after retiring from the Foreign Service in 1984, he entered into active  political life, and became an MP in the 1984 elections from Ottappalam in  Kerala, and became the Minister for Science and Technology in Rajiv Gandhi’s  government. &nbsp;As a politician, Sri Narayanan was respected by all in the  political system. &nbsp;After serving five years as Vice President, the support  for his candidature for Presidency was almost unanimous across the political  spectrum.. &nbsp;There is no one more deserving or more qualified than him to  occupy that august office. </p>
