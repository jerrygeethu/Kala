       <span style="font-size:25px; color:#925c21;"><strong>Autism</strong></span>
      <p>During my recent visit to  India, I came across an article written by a mother whose child was diagnosed  with autism. &nbsp;The article portrayed the difficulties she faced in  obtaining help for her son with autism and how she set up a parent support  group in Mumbai for parents with autistic children. &nbsp;This made me realise  about many children and adults with autism in India and how they may not be  receiving help. &nbsp;This also made me realise that autism is not a disorder  confined to western society, it is seen in many other cultural and ethnic  groups. Dr. Raghu Raghavan writes ...<br />
        <br />
  <strong>What is Autism?</strong><br />
        For many years, autism was  believed to be the result of being possessed by an evil spirit, similar to  other conditions like mental illness and personality disorders rather than a  developmental disability. &nbsp;The film 'Rain man' portrayed the picture of a  highly intelligent person with autism and the associated behaviours.</p>
      <p>As a result of scientific  studies, autism was initially identified as a syndromal collection of observed  behavioural symptoms, which emphasised the relative impairments of social  relationships and language. &nbsp;Children and adults with autism can be  distinguished from children and adults with other types of developmental  problems by using these basic features: </p>
      <p><em>        An impairment  in the ability to interact socially<br />
        Problems in  communication<br />
        Certain bizarre  behaviours<br />
        Bizarre  responses to sensory stimuli<br />
        Impairment in  the use of imagination or imaginary play.</em></p>
      <p>Many children and adults  with autism also have severe learning disabilities. &nbsp;They may also have  other disabilities such as visual impairment, hearing loss, physical disability  or a communication disorder such as word-finding difficulties.</p>
      <p>There is now general  acceptance among the scientifically oriented that autism is a  neuro-developmental disorder with an organic basis. &nbsp;The association with  epilepsy, the presence of neuro-biological abnormality, the lack of gross  environmental pathology, and the associations with a genetic basis and with  various medical causes of learning disability all combine to indicate both a  primary, inherited disorder and a secondary symptomatic one. &nbsp;Autism can  be diagnosed in the first three years and is more prevalent amongst boys than  girls.</p>
      <p><strong>Some common misconceptions  about Autism</strong><br />
        Autism is not a disease; it  is just a label for a collection of behaviours. &nbsp;It is not a mental illness.  &nbsp;Autism is not caused due to abnormal parenting. indeed, there was a  notion that children became autistic as a maladaptive response to a threatening  and unloving environment. &nbsp;Research in this field have discredited this  notion.</p>
      <p><strong>Management of Autism</strong><br />
        There are a large number of  treatment programmes on the market, many of which are very expensive both in  terms of money and in the amount of time family needs to dedicate to the  afflicted child. &nbsp;Based on different theoretical standpoints and addressing  different aspects of autism, these treatments claim global improvement in the  conditions of the patients, but such claims are not supported by comparative or  objective evaluation.</p>
      <p><strong>Education and Training</strong><br />
        It is believed that a  systematic and well-structured programme with clearly defined steps would  enable the child or adult with autism to learn social behaviours.</p>
      <p><strong>Communication Training</strong><br />
        This is aimed at developing  better communication by speech, sign or gesture.</p>
      <p><strong>Behaviour Management</strong><br />
        Children and adults with autism  show a range of stereotyped and ritualistic behaviour, which interfere with  learning. &nbsp;Aggressive behaviour is frequently seen in this population and  may represent a means of communication, or gaining attention, of relieving  boredom or be the response to a perceived threat. &nbsp;Behavioural management  should be based on a full assessment of the function of these behaviours  following a systematic behavioural approach.</p>
      <p><strong>Support for Family</strong><br />
        The families of autistic  children or adults will require a lot of help and support due to the disruptive  nature of the disorder. &nbsp;The care of a child or adult with autism is  difficult and puts unusual stress on the family and marriage. &nbsp;Parents  will need a lot of reassurance and practical ideas and support. &nbsp;Joining a  local parent support group and the National Autistic Society helps to remove  the sense of isolation and to provide practical ideas about specific forms of  help and how to obtain these.</p>
      <p>There is a lot of  misunderstanding regarding autism in our society. &nbsp;Many of those suffering  from autism do not get help and guidance. &nbsp;Autism still pose major  challenges to parents, clinicians and researchers as its nature, causative  factors and effective treatment approaches are still not well understood  despite the advances in medical science.</p>
