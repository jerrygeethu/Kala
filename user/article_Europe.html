       <p>It was an amazing  experience, being both educational and enjoyable. &nbsp;We travelled to 20  cities in 11 countries visiting both East and West Europe.The differences  between the East and the West are becoming less apparent as border controls  ease and the restrictions of communism fade. &nbsp;Two of our favourite cities  we visited were, in fact, Prague and Budapest. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
       <p>These two cities were very  scenic and full of atmosphere. Prague was especially cheap - a decent sized  meal coming to just over £1. &nbsp;Other than this we were surprised at how  western these two cities seemed to be. &nbsp;For a taste of the Eastern Europe  we were expecting, we visited Sofia in Bulgaria and Bucharest in Romania.  &nbsp;Sofia has a lot of impressive churches and we ended up seeing three  Bulgarian weddings! &nbsp;We stayed with a Bulgarian family who were so  friendly and went out of their way to please us. &nbsp;Bucharest seemed quite  serene with a huge palace as its main sight. &nbsp;We also hired a small rowing  boat and took a ride on a beautiful lake there for only a few pence each. </p>
       <p><img style="padding:10px;" src="images/europe2.jpg" alt="europe" align="right" />We also visited  Berlin, where a trip to the Checkpoint Charlie museum highlighted just how much  Eastern Europe has changed. &nbsp;The visit to the museum was actually quite  emotional, both harrowing stories of people trying to escape the DDR regime and  then videos of the reunification 28 years later were very moving. &nbsp;A lot  of the remnants of the old East Berlin have been destroyed, along with anything  to do with Hitler and the second world war. &nbsp;This is apparently, to stop  Neo-Nazis in Germany using such remains as shrines. &nbsp;I would definitely  recommend going on a guided walking tour in Berlin, as without a guide to  explain things to you, there isn't much to see.</p>
       <p>Standing on the ground  where some of the most horrendous atrocities had been committed was an  indescribable experience. &nbsp;We also visited a concentration camp, now a  memorial to those who died here, in Dachau. &nbsp;This too left us with the  same feeling. &nbsp;For further stories of World War II, we visited Anne  Frank's house in Amsterdam, where she and her family were in hiding from the  Nazis.</p>
       <p>The rest of our holiday was  much more light-hearted - whether it was strolling down the Champs-Elysee in  Paris on the way to the Eiffel Tower, chatting in the beer gardens in Munich,  taking a gondola ride on the canals in Venice, driving through the Alps (we  hired a car), appreciating the art in Florence and architecture in Rome,  exploring the remains of the Acropolis in Athens or relaxing on the red and  black beaches of Santorini (a Greek volcanic island) where the break from the  seemingly constant moving around was much appreciated. <br />

       <p>&nbsp;</p>
       <p>We often only got to spend  a day in a city due to lack of time, although in Pisa we stopped off for only a  couple of hours as, other than the famous leaning tower, there wasn't much else  to see there. &nbsp;In Zurich and Vienna our short stay was as a result of the  cities being too expensive. &nbsp;Occasionally, sleeping in the station waiting  room was necessary to avoid the unaffordable accommodation costs! &nbsp;Zurich  actually had a very pleasant and safe waiting room which was protected by  guards and only open to people in possession of a valid train ticket for the  next day. &nbsp;For girls travelling alone though, I would not recommend this  in the rest of the cities we visited. &nbsp;In these places, generally we were  very lucky with accommodation, and we managed to find nice but cheap places to  stay.</p>
       <p><img src="images/europe4.jpg" alt="europe4" align="right" />I think the  best thing about our holiday was the number of different people we met - both  locals and other Travellers. Everybody we came across was very hospitable.  &nbsp;Six weeks went far too quickly, though I was impressed at how much we  managed to cram in. &nbsp;It was an experience. &nbsp;I will never forget and  one I heartily recommend to anyone who has a desire to see and learn a little  bit more of life than they already have· </p>
