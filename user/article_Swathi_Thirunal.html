       <p>“I was at the  Barbican Centre the other day, expecting to be indulged in nostalgia, expecting  also for the famous acoustics of the Barbican to enhance the familiar voice of  the popular musician. &nbsp;Instead, the voice came through the synthesiser,  the rendition was more Classic FM than Radio 3. &nbsp;And sadly, Yesudas,  arguably the best and certainly the most famous musician from Kerala chose not  to sing the works of the only well known composer from Kerala.  &nbsp;Comparisons could be drawn, Yesudas has sung in several languages and  experienced discrimination from the establishment in Carnatic music in recent  times; the composer had composed in several languages, but was discriminated by  the classical music establishment of the day for some time. &nbsp;That composer  is Swathi Thirunal.&quot; </p>
       <p>Dr. Pat Nair reviews the  life and times of the great composer Swathi Thirunal</p>
       <p><strong>Early Days </strong></p>
       <p>Swathi Thirunal was born in  1813 in Trivandrum. &nbsp;His mother was the ruler of Travancore at the time as  his maternal grandfather had no male children. &nbsp;This gave him the right to  rule the country before being born and was therefore known as Garbhashriman.  &nbsp;He was named Rama Varma but as he was born on Swathi day according to  Astrology, tradition dictated that he could be called Swathi Thirunal.</p>
       <p>He took over as the ruler  in 1829. &nbsp;Until then, first his mother and then his sister ruled on his  behalf. &nbsp;He was educated in Indian languages and in English. &nbsp;He was  also trained music and musical instruments. &nbsp;Trivandrum enjoyed royal  patronage in performing arts; it also had the advantage of visiting artists  from Tanjore which had reputation for encouraging arts and artists the same way  as Raja Ravi Varma, the painter, experienced. &nbsp;Several artists from  Tanjore including Vadivel brothers, the eldest of whom had introduced Violin to  Carnatic music, visited Trivandrum during his time. &nbsp;Another great  composer, Iriyamman Thampi and his daughter Kuttikkunju Thankachi graced his  court. &nbsp;Although their main compositions were in the style of Kerala music  (Sopanam), they both also composed in the Carnatic style.</p>
       <p><strong>World of Music</strong></p>
       <p>Swathi Thirunal  composed over 500 pieces in different languages, he also adopted totally  different styles of different regions in India. &nbsp;He used the sanskrit  language often and composed in rare Ragas. &nbsp;The compositions varied from  light bhajans such as ‘Sarasaksha...' to complicated pieces such as ‘Janani  Mamava..’ &nbsp;Delicate feelings and gentle imaginations are expressed in  beautiful words showing the linguistic talents but following the complicated  rules of Carnatic music. &nbsp;His linguistic talent is exemplified in a book  he wrote on the use of language.</p>
       <p>His music is  devotional, mostly dedicated to Sri Padmanabha which he also used as a monogram  in the way composers do. &nbsp;Being the ruler, he did not have disciples who  could continue his work but his court was filled with artists of high calibre.  &nbsp;Shatkala Govinda Marar, Iriyamman Thampi, Sulaiman Seth and Palghat  Parameswara Bhagavathar were some of them. &nbsp;He did learn from others, like  a true scholar, and never stopped learning</p>
       <p>His music was to be played  at the Padmanabha Temple from early days onwards which perhaps helped to  maintain the music in its original format and remain ever-popular. &nbsp;He was  disillusioned with the reigning as the then British Resident increasingly interfered  with court matters which was not uncommon in the relationship between the  princely states of India and the colonial government. &nbsp;He eventually  retreated to a more spiritual existence towards the end of his days.</p>
       <p><strong>End of an Era</strong></p>
       <p>Swathi Thirunal passed on  in 1846. &nbsp;History has had several great sons who lived for just over 32  years and in that short time achieved what others can only dream about.  &nbsp;While comparing Swathi Thirunal against the more prolific and famous  composers such as Thyagarajah, Dikshitar and Sastri, it needs to be borne in  mind that they lived longer than he did.</p>
       <p>An institute, the Swathi  Thirunal School of Music, was established in Kerala belatedly five decades ago  to keep the memory of the most widely known composer from the state. &nbsp;Had  he not been of the royal family, establishing a Malayalee amongst the closed  society of Tamil and Telegu musicians would have been difficult in the 19th  century India.</p>
