       <p>&nbsp;</p>
       <p>On June 26th KALA’s members got up from their  couches and packed their bags for a ramble in the Hampshire countryside and a  canal boat cruise. &nbsp;There were about fifty of us. &nbsp;Our plan for the  morning was to walk around the small, quiet and peaceful village of North  Warnborough. &nbsp;We split into three groups, called green group, blue group and  red group. &nbsp;Each group took a different route. &nbsp;I was in the green  group. &nbsp;We passed different sites such as King John’s Castle. &nbsp;It was  used as a hunting lodge. &nbsp;The whole castle was made out of stones and its  windows were just holes. &nbsp;The whole castle is 800 years old. &nbsp;We also  passed lots of stinging nettles, brown trout, swans and ducks. &nbsp;Not many  people saw wild birds but there was lots of them around. &nbsp;</p>
       <p>Around 11.45 we  came to a farm with a lot of hay. &nbsp;We met together at the woods that was  scattered with wild rabbits. &nbsp;Along the way the track was very narrow,  sandy and was covered along the sides with wild plants. &nbsp;The place I think  was most interesting was a cave that has thousands of bats in it. &nbsp;There  is now a gate blocking the whole cave. &nbsp;We passed a farm too. &nbsp;It was  full of pigs, we also saw horses and cows. &nbsp;There was a pottery shop full  of artistic work.<br />
       <hr />
         The canal boat  was called John Pinkerton. &nbsp;It was 67 ft long and is able to carry 50  passengers. &nbsp;The boat ride cost £3.50 for adults and £2 for children under  16. &nbsp;We had a variety of home made foods and a bar inside too. &nbsp;We  had entertainment after and during lunch by uncle Sukumaran and other talented  Kala members. &nbsp;The canal boat cruise took 2 and a half hours. &nbsp;It  took us round through beautiful countryside and then returned to the wharf near  the car park. &nbsp;The whole cruise was lovely.</p>
       <p>My favourite  part was being able to climb the stiles. &nbsp;It was a bit tricky at the start  but I got used to it. &nbsp;The whole walk was over at 5:00 p.m. &nbsp;The  weather was hot in the morning but it then started spitting when we were all  going home safely inside the car. &nbsp;It was a successful and brilliant  outing thanks to the careful planning done.</p>
