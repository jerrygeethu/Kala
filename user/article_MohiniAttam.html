       <p>Mrs. Gauri  Menon continues her series on the dance forms of India. Here she looks at a  dance form that is close to every Malayalee's heart.</p>
       <p><strong><u><img style="padding:10px;" src="images/article_MohiniAttam_clip_image002.jpg" alt="mohiniattam" width="196" height="144" align="left" /></u></strong></p>
       <p>Like any other classical dance, Mohini Attam has  a colourful and romantic legendary background. &nbsp;The word means the dance  of the enchantress and the story is that the style originated from the dance  performed by Mohini, the enchantress. &nbsp;The story goes thus <br />
         -The mighty  Asura King, Bhasmasura, wanting to acquire greater strength began meditating on  Siva and such was the severity of his penance that the three worlds shuddered.  &nbsp;Siva appeared before him and asked him what he wished for - the  interesting part is that Siva being highly cosmopolitan makes no distinction  between Suras and Asuras - Also he is a Kshipra Prasadi - one easily pleased.  &nbsp;Replied the demon King, &quot;O' Siva, bless me with this boon. Any  object I touch must get reduced to ashes at the very moment.&quot;  &nbsp;&quot;Your wish is granted,&quot; said Siva.</p>
       <p>Bhasmasura had  an uncanny notion. &nbsp;Why not make Siva himself as the first test case?  &nbsp;The Asura was approaching Lord Siva with his hands out-stretched.  &nbsp;What a situation! In a trice there appeared in front of the Asura the  loveliest of damsels... Bhasmasura stood dazed... &nbsp;Completely bewitched.  &nbsp;It was beauty personified. &nbsp;Slowly the maiden began to dance.  &nbsp;Asura felt she was wanting him to follow her movements and started  imitating the dancer - Mohini, the enchantress. &nbsp;Little did he know that  it was Vishnu, the Lord who protected every one, who was in front of him  disguised as Mohini. &nbsp;As the dancing continued, the speed also  increased... &nbsp;Mohini began making several gestures, Asura copying her -  the final gesture was touching one's own head. &nbsp;The infatuated demon had  only Mohini in his mind and ... in an instant the Asura was enveloped in  flames. &nbsp;&nbsp;There he lay a heap of ashes. &nbsp;The demon king was thus  by his own lure reduced to ashes.<br />

       <p>         - Nandikeswara in  Abhinaya Darpana<br />
         <hr />
         Like other classical dances of India, Môhini  Âttam &nbsp;also consists of Nritta &nbsp;(Percussary dance) Nritya  (Interpretative dance ) and Abhinaya (mime) - the last in this type is further  subdivided into Ângilea - Vâchika, Âhârya and Sâtwika forms as mentioned in  Abhinaya Darpana. &nbsp;&nbsp;While most other classical styles are based on  the tenets laid down by the great saint Bharatha in his Nâtya Sâstra, this  style - Môhini Âttam, abides by the said tenets and also adheres to the  principles enunciated by Nandikeswara in his Abhinaya Darpana. &nbsp;Hasthâs  are used in Asamyukta (single hand), Samyuktra (both hands) and in Misra  &nbsp;(either way) positions. &nbsp;The bobbing gait forward - backward or side  ways and the graceful swaying of the trunk or head are special to this style.  &nbsp;The basic sitting posture with the feet apart is reminiscent of Kathakali  - the basic unit of movement is known as kalâsam as in Kathakali , &nbsp;but  the parallel goes no further. &nbsp;But for the music accompanying which again  as in Kathakali &nbsp;&nbsp;is in the Sôpâna style with its typical slow tempo.  While Kathakali slides to religious connotations and to the rigid formalities  of a traditional art, Môhini Âttam is free of the traditional rigid formalism -  the items are very earthly and almost coquettish. &nbsp;That helps the dancer  to be subjective and thereby establish an immediate rapport with the audience.  &nbsp;Basically, it is the Nayika (heroine) a devotee pining for the Deva or  Nayaka &nbsp;(hero). &nbsp;Chari &nbsp;&nbsp;(special type of movement) and  Nritta Mudra &nbsp;(hand movement without any special meaning) are special to  Mohini Attam. <br />
  &nbsp;<br />
         Coming to the various items,  there is similarity with Bharata Natyam. &nbsp;The invocatory dance Cholkkattu  performed in praise of Siva and Parvathi is very similar to Alarippu and Sabdam  of Bharata Natyam. &nbsp;But while in Bharatha Natyam the Jatis are recited  separately, here they are incorporated into the main melody of the Varnam.  &nbsp;Padams, Kirtis, Thillana, Javalis and Slokas are the varying items in  Mohini attam as well.</p>
       <p>The costume  worn is something between the robe of the female characters in Kathakali and  the traditional sophisticated attire of the ancient Kerala women - invariably  the sari is pure white with gold border. Hair is tied into a bun in the  traditional way and decked with gold ornaments and flowers. Heavy stony gold  ornaments as well as gold choker, Odyanam and bangles are a must - of course  heavy anklets as well.<br />
         <br />
         &nbsp;Mohini Attam is definitely of more  recent origin, unlike Bharata Natyam and Kathakali. &nbsp;Critics and scholars  have varying opinions regarding its age. &nbsp;While some believe this art goes  back to the days of Silappadikaram between the end of the 2nd century A.D. and  the beginning of the 3rd century A.D., others maintain it developed more  recently out of the traditional folk dances in Kerala. &nbsp;Are the classical  and folk dances really exclusive? &nbsp;Study shows that while the classical  types provide the thematic content and gravity to folk dances the latter  provides freshness and buoyancy to the classical variety thus helping to make  it less stereotyped. &nbsp;One thing is certain. &nbsp;The art is evolved in  the present form in the court of our celebrated music composer Swathi Thirunal  maharajah. &nbsp;Assisted by that gifted Natya Vidwan Vadivelu Nattuvanar, one  of the famous Tanjore Quartet, this great ruler - cum·-·composer gave  refinement and form to a vaguely existing dance style. &nbsp;Perhaps it has to  fill in the vacuum between the highly ritualistic dances of the temples such as  Krishnanattam and the crude secular folk dances or it could also have been  developed as the dance of the fair sex - being typically Lasya - to entertain  royalty and the court - or again may be the Maharajah felt the need for a  special type of dance for the women in the classical style as in Kathakali and  in other dances women are not participating. &nbsp;Whatever the reason, Mohini  attam has certainly a distinctive classical individuality of its own and it is  perfectly feminine being pure Lasya. &nbsp;If Swathi Thirunal Maharaja, gave  Mohini attam the required style and form, certainly it was Mahakavi Vallathol  who made it one of the most popular classical dances of the present day.  &nbsp;It was a Herculean task. &nbsp;With great dedication and fervour the  great poet of Kerala started the now world- famous dance institution Kala  Mandalam in the early 1930s. &nbsp;But for his untiring enthusiasm, our  classical dances such as Kathakali and Mohiniyattam and several other dances  would never ever have come to limelight. &nbsp;Kalliani Kutty Amma, Shanta Rao,  Thara Raja Kumar, Kanak Rele and Chandrabhaga Devi are a few of the gifted  Mohini Attam dancers who dedicated their lives for the revival of the exquisite  Lasya form and whose names could remain in the minds ïf the art lovers of all  time.</p>
