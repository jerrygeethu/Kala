       <p>In the final  part of her series on Indian classical dance forms, Mrs Gouri Menon narrates  the rhythmic movements and sounds that make Kathak an enthralling feast for  spectators' senses.</p>
       <p><br />
           <strong><u><img style="padding:10px;" src="images/article_Kathak_clip_image002.jpg" alt="kathak" width="172" height="255" align="left" /></u></strong></p>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>
       <p>India's ancient cultural heritage is unique in  its richness and complexity. &nbsp;Virtually every region has a variety of performing  arts - songs, dramas and dances, to express man's many moods, his joys,  sorrows, dreams and ambitions, and expression of human desire to re-discover  our tradition and culture. &nbsp;The rhythm of the drum, the tinkling bells on  the dancing feet and the plaintive singing voice may be elaborating the pangs  of separation or the joys of reunion, have all been integral part of the Indian  psyche. &nbsp;Luckily there has been a re-awakening since the late thirties and  the performing arts have gradually become vital and flourishing. &nbsp;The  result is arts like Kathakali and Bharathanatyam gained popularity  internationally.<br />
         <br />
         Kathakali,  Bharathanatyam, Mohiniyattam, Manipuri, Odissi, Kuchipudi and Kathak are  regarded as art dances or classical dances on account of their sophisticated  stylisation. &nbsp;Each has a link with antiquity, literature, sculpture and  musical traditions of the ancient and medieval India - of course the influence  of each particular region affecting it as well. &nbsp;However in all dances,  the principles enunciated by the great sage Bharatha are adhered to, namely,  the division of dance into Nrita (pure or abstract), Nritya (dance with mime or  Abhinaya) of Thandava and Lasya of styled presentation (Natyadharmi). &nbsp;At  the same time the technique of movement in each style is distinctive. </p>
       <p><strong><u><img style="padding:10px;" src="images/article_Kathak_clip_image004.jpg" alt="kathak" width="93" height="216" align="right" /></u></strong><strong><u>   </u></strong>Kathak, hailing from northern India, is an Urban  sophisticated style full of virtuosity and intricate craftsmanship. &nbsp;It is  generally identified with the court traditions of the later Nawabs of northern  India, but, in reality Kathak is an amalgam of several folk dances - the  traditional dance drama forms prevalent in the temples of Mathura of Brindavan,  known as the Krishna-Radha lilas as well as the sophistication of the court  tradition of later years. &nbsp;Though its origins are old, its present format  is new. &nbsp;</p>
       <p>The present  form is attributed to the genius of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah and to the hereditary  musician dancer Pandit Thakar Prasadji. &nbsp;The contemporary repertoire was  evolved by a few families of traditional dancers in the last hundred years.<br />
         <br />
         In technique,  Kathak is two dimensional - always following a vertical position - no breaks -  no deflections. &nbsp;It is the most important part of the footwork.  &nbsp;Innumerable rhythmic patterns with varying emphasis are to be mastered  and the result is that the hundred odd ankle bells produce a fantastic range of  sound and rhythm.</p>
       <p>Straight walks,  gliding movement, fast pirouettes (the spinning movement of the body while  being balanced either on the tip of the toe or on the ball of the foot),  changing tempo, the pace ofmovement and meterical patterns constitute the  beauty and dexterity of this very special art dance. &nbsp;The pure dance  sequences comprise units (tukra) akin to adavu in Bharathanatyam, arasa in  Odissi and kalasam in Kathakali.<br />
         <br />
         As in other  dances the performer begins with an invocation either to a particular divine  form (Ganesh etc.) or to the chief patron in the audience. &nbsp;Amad and salam  is the first item. &nbsp;The next item is an exposition of slow delicate  movements of the eyebrows, eyes, lateral neck and shoulder movements.  &nbsp;Tukra and toras follow presentation of phrases of rhythmic patterns.  &nbsp;Time cycles are repeated, giving complexity to it. </p>
       <p>Pirouettes  arranged in groups of three, six, nine, twelve etc. generally mark a finale. &nbsp;Pure  dance (Nrita) sections are followed by short interpretative pieces performed to  a repetitive melodic line, while mime (Abhinaya) is performed to lyrics in  Hindi and Brajbhasha, both tongues well known to villagers and urban dwellers  alike. &nbsp;In Nrita, the dancer is at liberty to improvise. &nbsp;A healthy  competition with the percussionist is common. &nbsp;While in mime, the range of  improvisation on the poetic line is the test of a dancer's talent.</p>
       <p>Accompaniment  comprises a vocalist, a percussionist (instrument being a Pakkaraj or tabalas -  pair of drums), an instrumentalist who plays the repetitive melodic lines,  nagina (other musical instruments are optional) for embellishment.</p>
       <p>Works of famous  dancers like Uday Shankar did not leave the traditional dancers unaffected.  &nbsp;Their aim was to compose dance first, music following - creating ballets  like Ramayana and Panchathantra. &nbsp;Theme is old, but conception and  treatment new. &nbsp;Imitating Uday Shankar's way, the modern trend seems to be  to let the theme be rooted in tradition and allow refreshing departures and  innovations in other sections.</p>
