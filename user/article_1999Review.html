     <div class="contactDiv1" ><span style="font-size:25px; color:#925c21;"><strong> Review of the Year 1999 </strong> </span> <br />
       <em>Murali Nair reports on the progress achieved by KALA so far... </em>
       <p><strong><u> </u></strong>It is that time again to  have our usual review of the year. &nbsp;A lot of water has flowed under the  bridge since the last year's review and many Malayali brethren have laid down  their lives in the battle of Kargil. &nbsp;We pay our respect to the bravery of  those who fought there.</p>
       <p>Back to KALA's activities  during the past twelve months. &nbsp;Each year has been better than the one  before. &nbsp;Undoubtedly, the year was the most hectic period of cultural  activities since Kala's birth lust over three years go.</p>
       <p><strong>The Second Annual Meeting</strong><br />
         The Second Annual Meeting  of Kala, held on October 1998 at Bushey Mead School Hall was graced by chief  guest, poet Professor Madhusudanan Nair, Guest of Honour Dr. Krishnan Nair,  Director of Regional Cancer Centre in Thiruvananthapuram and a gathering of distinguished  friends of KALA. &nbsp;While Professor Madhusudanan Nair shared his poetic wit  and wisdom with the audience, Dr. Krishnan Nair talked about his experience as  a doctor who has eminently practised medicine both in England and India.  &nbsp;We were also fortunate to have Shri Jayan of “JayaVijaya twins” as a  special guest, who took to the stage and sung memorable songs, which enthralled  the audience.</p>
       <p>The evening was full of  entertainment with dance (Bharatha Natyam and folk dances) by talented UK  Malayali dancers. &nbsp;There was slide presentation on Kathakali, which gave  an opportunity to the younger members to have a look at Kerala's great art.  &nbsp;This was followed by a Kathakali performance “Poothana Moksham” which  went down well with the audience, young and old alike. &nbsp;There were other  unique items like Mridangam and informal spontaneous vocal entertainment by  Kala members. &nbsp;The gathering was well fed by specially arranged caterers  for an authentic Kerala taste, followed by plenty more entertainment of song  and dance, and made it a truly memorable evening.</p>
       <p><strong>The Spring Meeting</strong><br />
         The Spring Meeting is also  the Annual General Meeting of the KALA members, where the organisational  matters are discussed and agreed. &nbsp;At the end of the formal deliberations,  there was a specially arranged Quiz programme, which was entertaining as well  as competitive. &nbsp;At the end we could see the testimony that there were  several members with high levels of knowledge, who won the coveted prize.</p>
       <p>The evening also witnessed  the debut of the mathematical human computer, Kala's own home grown Guru  Kukkudanandan assisted by his disciple (shishyan) Mannunni, amazing the crowd  with his mathematical and memory prowess.</p>
       <p>Kala’s young members  provided entertainment for the evening with a piece of classical dance and a  sketch adapted from the award winning BBC series &quot;Goodness Gracious  Me&quot;. &nbsp;As usual the meeting concluded with a lot of songs by Kala's  own hand of musicians.</p>
       <p><strong>Summer Event</strong><br />
         This years summer event was  on 26th June. &nbsp;It was a combination of ramble in the Hampshire countryside  and a canal boat trip, thoughtfully chosen by the organising committee.  &nbsp;Taking precautions as not to disturb the tiny village community or the  wildlife, the members were split in three small groups. &nbsp;At the end of a  tiring three-hour criss-crossing walk through wheat- fields, wild meadows,  woods and canal towpaths the party gathered aboard the boat John Pinkerton to  have the second part of the programme, with plenty of home cooked variety  Kerala dishes. &nbsp;Perhaps it was for the first time so much variety of  Kerala fares - food and “Vanchippat” - were served aboard the boat John  Pinkerton.</p>
       <p><strong>Food Tasting and Medical  Symposium</strong><br />
         The idea behind organising  this event is to fill the long gap between the formal AGM in March and the Annual  Meeting in October. &nbsp;In spite of people visiting India during summer  vacation, the participation in this year's symposium was high in numbers and  liveliness. &nbsp;The &quot;Food Tasting&quot; preceded symposium. &nbsp;It was  where Kala discovered its own Spice Girls&quot; of different denominations.  &nbsp;We have all of them, you name it we have them. &nbsp;The food was rich in  quality and variety, made by 21 families. &nbsp;&quot;Food Tasting&quot; was  perhaps a misnomer. &nbsp;&quot;Koodiyoot&quot; might have been more apt, one  could say. &nbsp;Of course it was traditional Kerala cuisine, nothing else -  Pulyinchi to Payasam. &nbsp;Aviyal, Kalan, Pachhadi, Thoran, Theeyal, Sambar  and Mezhukku puratti to name a few dishes. &nbsp;As if these were not enough,  for those fond of non-vegetarian items, there were varieties of mutton curries,  chicken and fish made in different regional styles. &nbsp;To realise how  successful the event was, I quote the extract of some of the comments received  from the participants: “Never attended a combination of these two”, “A good  thinking and well arranged”, “Plenty of variety foods”, “Excellent vegetarian  items”, “Good participation from the audience during question time”.</p>
       <p>It is more likely that by  popular demand this mid term &quot;side show&quot; will gain in strength and  become as important and enriching like the other Kala Events, before long.</p>
       <p><strong>Third Annual Meeting 23rd  October 1999</strong><br />
         As in the previous Annual  Meetings, this year also we are expecting it to be a truly memorable event. Sri  Madhu, the award winning film actor, has kindly agreed to grace the occasion.  &nbsp;There are other surprises too, details of which are given in the News and  Views page of this magazine.</p>
       <p><strong>The Palm Leaf</strong><br />
         This review will not be  complete without saying a few word about The Palm Leaf, Kala's voice line to  you, the reader. There were two issues in the last twelve months - the Annual  Issue published in October 98 and the Spring issue published in March 99.  &nbsp;As I said in the last review, Palm Leaf occupies the pride of place in  Kala's activities. &nbsp;Fortunately The Palm Leaf receives inspiration and  support of all Kala members and others those who love Kerala's arts and  literature, and we hope that such patronage and contributions will continue  from our well-wishers,</p>
