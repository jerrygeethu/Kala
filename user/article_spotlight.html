       <em>Sedhumadhavan Menon      </em>
       <p><strong><u> </u></strong><em>The Palm Leaf begins a series of interviews – under the spotlight – with  members of KALA to get to know them better. &nbsp;Here, as the first in the  series, Viswasmitran turns the spotlight on Sethumadhavan Menon who recently  stepped down from the treasurership (1996-1999) of KALA. &nbsp;Sethu grew up  near Palakkad and graduated in mechanical engineering from Trichur. &nbsp;He  has been with a well – known engineering firm for many years and travels widely  on business. &nbsp;He lives in Maidenbower, Sussex with his wife Indira.  &nbsp;They have two daughters, Sheila and Anita. </em> </p>
       <p><em><strong>Many of us know  you as the hard–working treasurer of KALA. &nbsp;We also know that you have  become a “regular” on certain long haul flights. &nbsp;Could you tell us what  you do in these exotic places you fly in to?</strong></em></p>
       <p>Certainly not  the things I would have really liked to do! &nbsp;I am a specialist in the  design of large boiler plants for power generation. &nbsp;I go to China, Japan  and USA to take part in project discussions and design review meetings with  clients and consortium partners, to do presentation to clients and also to  support our subsidiary in India in negotiations with clients. &nbsp;&nbsp;I am  also involved in the recruitment and training of engineers for our set–up in  Chennai and in assisting the transfer of technology to the Indian subsidiary.</p>
       <p><strong><em>Having seen  these places, where would you like to live and enjoy life, if you had no other  commitments that bind you to a particular place?</em></strong></p>
       <p>I was born and  brought up at Tattamangalam near Palakkad. &nbsp;Although I have been in the UK  for the last 33 years, it is hard to forget the first 21 years of my life in  kerala. &nbsp;Most certainly, I like to spend a major part of my retirement  life there, preferably in Calicut or Ernakulam. &nbsp;&nbsp;The various  festivities and cultural events in Kerala are, no doubt, going to be more appealing  to me now than in my early years there. &nbsp;Thanks to the western influence  in this respect.</p>
       <p><em><strong>What are your  favourite food and drink? &nbsp;What is the most exotic/ memorable food you  have had?</strong></em></p>
       <p>I enjoy both  eastern and western food, quite fussy about the tastes though. &nbsp;Although I  can name a number of dishes as my favourite food, the most I like is the south  Indian vegetarian meal with a hot mango pickle served on a plantain leaf.  &nbsp;&nbsp;As far as drink is concerned, certainly a strong cup of Indian tea,  especially with a couple of “Paper Roasts.”</p>
       <p>The most exotic  and memorable food I have been served is Fried Silk Worm that was a delicacy at  a banquet given to us in China by one of our clients. &nbsp;Did I eat it?  &nbsp;I will leave you to guess.</p>
       <p><strong><em>What is your  favourite pastime?</em></strong></p>
       <p>It used to be  playing Bridge. &nbsp;Unfortunately, I haven’t had many opportunities lately to  pursue that interest. &nbsp;I hope to take it up again one day in the future.</p>
       <p><strong><em>What was the  most enjoyable part of being KALA’s treasurer? &nbsp;And the least enjoyable?</em></strong></p>
       <p>I enjoyed  working with the team. &nbsp;Besides, our determination to project KALA in a  major way right from the start required substantial income, much more than the  income from the membership fees; finding ways and means of raising the  additional income within certain constraints was quite challenging.  &nbsp;However, collection of money from members was not a pleasant experience.</p>
       <p><em><strong>You were quite  meticulous in controlling costs. &nbsp;For example, you never allowed the  printing of many complimentary copies of the Palm Leaf. &nbsp;&nbsp;Did you  have to be that strict?</strong></em></p>
       <p>Perhaps not,  but others like you have their own priorities and could ask similar questions.  &nbsp;I believe that for effective control of expenditure, a treasurer will  have to draw the line somewhere and stick to it consistently, especially when  there is only some loose change justify in the kitty.</p>
       <p><em><strong>What advice  would you give to your successor?</strong></em></p>
       <p>I do not  believe my successor would need any advice from me. &nbsp;However, just to  respond to your question, I should say that effective control of expenditure  and ensuring a positive cash balance are essential to KALA’s success.  &nbsp;This obviously requires timely forecasts, proper budgeting and finding  appropriate measures to raise income.</p>
       <p><strong><em>What message do  you have for the members of KALA?</em></strong></p>
       <p>KALA is, no  doubt, unique in many ways when compared with other similar associations.  Thanks to the predident Dr. Sukumaran Nair for all his initiative and  enthusiasm without which KALA would not have gained recognition in a span of  just over two years. Now it is upto all its members to put in their earnest  efforts to fulfill Sukumaran's vision of turning KALA into an organisation  recognised by Malayalees all over the world. </p>
