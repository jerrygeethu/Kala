       <p><strong><u> </u></strong><strong>KALA  Celebrates 11th Annual Day</strong></p>
       <p>In every sense the  celebration of the 11th Annual Day of Kerala Arts and Literary  Association (KALA) UK  on 20th October 2007 was a truly remarkable and enriching experience  that lingered for days in one’s mind. The event was held at the Parmiter’s  School Auditorium in Watford. The occasion was  graced by the Chief Guest Prof. Vishnu Narayanan Nambudiri, Guests of Honour  Dr. George Gheverghese Joseph, Professor of Mathematics and author, Civic  Ambassador and Chairperson of Newham, Mrs. Omana Gangadharan, the Kathakali artiste,  Shri Kottakkal Sasidharan Nair, and the corporate entertainer, Shri Praveen Chulliparambil.  On this occasion KALA honoured Prof Vishnu Narayanan Nambudiri by presenting  him with the Life Time Achievement Award in recognition of his commendable  contribution to Indian poetry, Vedic wisdom and heritage. The award was  presented by KALA Patron, Dr. P. Sukumaran Nair in the presence of KALA  President Mrs. Geetha Menon and other distinguished guests.</p>
       <p>The Annual Day  celebrations brought out much more than the usual splendour of artistic  programmes through a unique musical presentation of poetry and dance and  thought provoking and humorous sketches and skits. The Chief Guest, Prof.  Vishnu Nambudiri, pointed out that the occasion provided a meeting ground for  many eminent persons who had nurtured a wish for many years to meet the other  personalities. Dr. George Gheverghese Joseph, the author of &quot;The Crest of  the Peacock: non-European Roots of Mathematics&quot; and many other  publications spoke of the great contributions that Kerala had made to  mathematics several centuries ago, which has not been recognised by the western  countries. Civic Ambassador Mrs. Omana Gangadharan spoke of her great  satisfaction at being able to meet the eminent chief guest and other guests,  and wished all success to KALA in its activities. </p>
       <p>As far as entertainments  went, there was a fabulous line up of programmes starting with a tableau titled  “Incredible India”, ably performed by very young performers of KALA, colourfully  depicting India’s  diverse culture. This was followed by an impressive dance medley ‘East meets  West’ choreographed and presented by the Youth members of KALA. KALA also paid  tribute to the work of the late author and poet, Padmasree Dr. Ayyappa Paniker.  Solo and well-remembered songs sung by Mrs. Susha Ashok Kumar and Praveen  Gopinath added a hint of nostalgia to the evening.</p>
       <p>The powerful and enchanting  Kathakali presentation, “Krishnakatha”, by Shri Kottakkal Sasidhran Nair through  the exquisite combination of <em>Aangikam, Mudra, Abhiynayam, Sabdam and  Sangeetam</em> had the audience spellbound. The highlight of the evening was the  dance drama, “Muthiyum Chozhiyum”, based on the poem by Padmasree ONV Kurup. It  was a unique presentation, bringing to life an old rural folk art once common  in some of Kerala’s villages and involving the participation of very talented KALA  members. Dr. Mayadevi Kurup choreographed the dance drama.</p>
       <p>The post-dinner programmes  also caught the interest of the audience. A fusion of instrumental music with  Manoj Siva on the tabla and Hari on the violin, with Dr. Sethumadhavan  providing vocal support, created a magical experience for the audience. ‘Mukhamukham’  with Prof. Vishnu Narayanan Nambudiri and Dr. George Joseph was an occasion for  sharing their insights and experiences with the audience. Dr. Manoj Kumar,  Editor of KALA’s in-house magazine, the Palmleaf, handed the first copy of the  Annual issue to Prof. Vishnu Narayanan Nambudiri who presented it to the Civic  Ambassador, Mrs. Omana Gangadharan, for its release. The variety of this year’s  entertainment did not end there - Mr. Praveen Chulliparambil captured the  attention of both young and old alike with his show ‘The Sixth Sense’, by weaving  a magical concoction of mentalism and illusion.   </p>
