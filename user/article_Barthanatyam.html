       <p>For untold centuries, India has been a veritable  treasure-chest of dance and music. &nbsp;Indian mythology is brimming with  stories of celestial damsels enchanting even the Rishies with their exquisite  histrionic talents. &nbsp;It is said, Devendra, the king of all gods, is  entertained in the Indrasabha throughout the night with the loveliest dances by  the Apsara beauties - Urvasi, Menaka, Rambha and Thilothama. &nbsp;Throughout  the night! &nbsp;Yes! Those heavenly beings know no sleep; their eyes are ever  open it seems… and they live eternally!</p>
       <p>Mrs. Gauri  Menon continues her series on the Classical Dances of India...<strong><u><img src="images/article_Barthanatyam_clip_image002.jpg" alt="dance" width="155" height="231" align="left" style="padding:10px;" /></u></strong><br />
         <br />
         In its present  form Bharatha Natyam has been known for about two hundred years. While its  poses are reminiscent of sculptures dating from the 10th century, the thematic  and musical contents were given to it by the musicians of the Tanjore court of  the 18th and l9th centuries. It is essentially a solo dance though it is very  rarely performed in pairs. A body of technique is developed from the  fundamental position of the out-turned thighs, flexed knees and out-turned feet  close together. Its chiselled sophistication and stylisation make it a unique  form of classical dance. Compositions of Carnatic music provide the repertory. <br />
         The unit of  movement in footwork is known as Adavu. The dancer has scope to improvise  within the rhythmic arrangement of beats known as Thâla. The Orchestra consists  of a vocalist, a violinist who accompanies the singer, a Mridangam player, a  cymbal player who also recites the pnemonics and a Thambura player who helps to  maintain the Sruthi. All members of the orchestra remain seated on one side of  the stage.</p>
       <p>The programme  commences with Alârippu. The word Alârippu means the blossoming of a flower. It  is a traditional invocatory dance, a simple form of Nritta danced to rhythmic  syllables. Generally it is performed to a Slôka in praise of Ganesha, the remover  of all obstacles. &nbsp;The dancer also offers flowers to Lord Nataraja (the  dancing Siva) beside the lighted bronze lamp, then seeks blessings from her  guru, orchestra and the audience.</p>
       <p><strong>Jathiswaram</strong><br />
         Jathi is a  characteristic pattern of footworks (Adavus). &nbsp;Several intricate patterns  of footwork are incorporated within a framework. &nbsp;The dancer executes  varied rhythms to the same pattern of musical notes. &nbsp;It may be a single  Raga or a Râgamâlika. &nbsp;It has only musical notes (Swaras); it has no  Sahitya. &nbsp;Again, like Alârippu, this is just Nritta. &nbsp;Jathiswaram is  also known as Swara Pallavi.</p>
       <p><strong>Shabdam</strong><br />
         Here. Bhâva or  Abhinaya, along with Sahitya(verbal) are present. &nbsp;It comes under the  group Nritya. &nbsp;Syama Sastri's song &quot;Oh Jagadamba..” in Ânanda  Bhairavi is an example. &nbsp;In Shabdam, the dancer praises the deity through  Bhâva and Abhinaya.</p>
       <p><strong>Varnam</strong><br />
         This is the  most elaborate and central part of the programme. &nbsp;The dancer has full  scope to demonstrate her talents in Bhâva, movements and footwork. &nbsp;Each  line of Varnam is followed by the Theermanams, consisting of intricate  footwork, hand movements and body bends, ending in fast finales.  &nbsp;(Naturally at the end of each Theermanam there is thunderous applause  from the audience!).</p>
       <p>Like Shabdam,  Varnam also comes under the group Nritya and involves Abhinaya. &nbsp;Varnam is  very strenuous and generally an hour. &nbsp;In fact, this musical part by  itself is a concert and it really is a harmonious feast for eyes and ears!  &nbsp;“Sakhiye...” by Ponnaih Pillai is an example.</p>
       <p><strong>Padam</strong> <br />
         This is a sort  of musical monologue. &nbsp;The dancer uses all her imagination and creativity  in bringing out the beauty of the song. &nbsp;Generally emphasis is on the  Bhâva of the Nâyika (heroine) and Nâyaka (hero). &nbsp;It depicts Bhakthi, love  or erotic sentiments such as playful deceits. &nbsp;Jayadeva’s Ashtapadi is a  good example. &nbsp;The Padams of composer Kshetratnya are very popular,  especially the one “Manchi Dinamu.” &nbsp;&nbsp;Swathi Thirunal's padam in Raga  Surutti “Alar Sara Parithaapam” is very beautiful.</p>
       <p><strong>Javali</strong> <br />
         This can be  considered as a kind of Padam though not so devotional but quite appealing.  &nbsp;Iriyamman Thampi's composition in kamboji Raga, &quot;Prâna Nâthan Eniyku  Nalkiya…” is a secret Javali.</p>
       <p><strong>Thillâna</strong> <br />
         This final item  of the performance is the most exquisite with a number of sculpturesque poses  in variegated patterns - it is the very embodiment of grace and elegance.  &nbsp;The emphasis is not only on Jathis (footworks) but also on the precision  of the technique. &nbsp;This is rightly considered the crowning piece of the  programme. &nbsp;Thanom Tha Na Na in Râga Paras by Srinivas Iyengar is an  example. &nbsp;Usually at the end of this part, the dancer comes and stands in  front of the microphone to say a few words of thanks to her guru, the orchestra  and the audience.</p>
       <p><strong>Mangalam</strong> <br />
         Mangalam is a  very brief item that ends the programme.<br />
        <hr />
  &quot;Its  chiselled sophistication and stylisation make Bharatha Nâtyam a unique form of  classical dance&quot;<br />
        <hr />
         <p>One important  feature of Bharatha Natyam is its complete freedom from other influences or  impressions. &nbsp;It is pure Nritta (dance in the abstract form) and Nritya  (dance with Bhâva or Abhinaya) and adheres strictly to the principles  enunciated by Sage Bharatha. &nbsp;Kathak for instance is in reality an amalgam  of the dance-drama forms prevalent in the temples of Mathura and Brindavan  known as Krishna-Radha leelas and the sophistication of the court traditions of  the later Nawabs of Northern India. &nbsp;Bharata Natyam is Lâsya basically and  not Thândava, and that explains why it was performed by only women until  recently.
