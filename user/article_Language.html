       <p><strong><u> </u></strong>The debate  about the importance of the younger generation learning Malayalam has been with  us right from the start of KALA and beyond that, I'm sure. &nbsp;Is Malayalam  really essential, seeing as the youth of KALA have mostly been brought up in  Britain and use English as their first language? &nbsp;Do the Malayali youth of  today need to know Malayalam to learn about the rich heritage of Kerala? &nbsp;I  have heard many points of view on this subject and The Palm Leaf has decided to  formalise this topic into a written debate. &nbsp;I sent a set of questions to  a selected number of parents and young adults within KALA families to kick  start the debate. &nbsp;The responses I received are given below; they clearly  show the different perspectives of people on the subject. &nbsp;The range of  opinions expressed here illustrate individuals' views on where we came from as  a linguistic community and where we are going. - Preethi Gopinath<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
1. Do you think  it is important for Malayali children growing up in Britain to learn Malayalam?  &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;<br />
PARENTS'  PERSPECTIVE</p>
       <p>P Ramachandran:</p>
       <p>It is good if  Malayali children growing up in Britain like to learn Malayalam and put in  extra effort, even if they do not communicate in this language even with their  parents. &nbsp;Fluency in Malayalam will be a social asset when they attend  functions like that of KALA and when they visit Kerala.</p>
       <p>G K Nair:</p>
       <p>Yes. Because it  is our mother tongue which is spoken by our parents and families in India as  well as in England. &nbsp;To understand and validate our cultural identity it  is necessary to learn Malayalam.</p>
       <p>Dr P Nair:</p>
       <p>It is good if  children are able to learn Malayalam. &nbsp;But that is not a high priority.</p>
       <p>Dr PM Ali:</p>
       <p>It is difficult  to be dogmatic about it. As I am very fond of my mother tongue, I can not  expect my children to have same feeling towards Malayalam. Moreover, the  children growing up in England or in any other country other than in India, may  find it very difficult to learn a language, which is not spoken by their peers.  If those children are going to grow up here and settle down here , then I can  not possibly say that learning Malayalam is very imperative. The sad thing is  that the children growing up in Kerala now opt to learn English and other  languages and not learning Malayalam at all. This is more worrying as these  children once grown, will have nothing In common with the ordinary people.</p>
       <p>Balasanker:</p>
       <p>Yes. It will  help children to communicate with their parents and understand about Kerala  better.</p>
       <p>K Natarajan:</p>
       <p>It will be  quite useful, though not essential for Malayali children growing up n Britain  to earn Malayalam. &nbsp;It will help in a better understanding of our culture  and will enhance inter-personal relationships when they visit India, even when  on short holidays.<br />
       </p>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>
       <p><strong>YOUNG ADULTS'  PERSPECTIVE</strong></p>
       <p>Manoj  Ramachandran:</p>
       <p>It will be nice  to learn Malayalam properly, to be able to fluently communicate in one more  language. &nbsp;Such fluency is also helpful for an outsider to understand the  ethos and the culture when lie/she visits the area where the language is  spoken.</p>
       <p>Sheela Nair:</p>
       <p>Language is an  art form and in Malayalam there is a wealth of literature that would be lost if  the language is not upheld. &nbsp;It would be ideal if those who settled in a  country outside their own could pass on their traditional languages to the next  generation. &nbsp;However as with many older languages (notably Gaelic and  Latin) this will only happen if the next generation itself develop an interest.</p>
       <p>Geetha  Balasanker:</p>
       <p>Being bilingual  or even multilingual is a very useful skill. &nbsp;Anything that eases  communication between people should be encouraged. &nbsp;Of course being  Malayali, it would be great if we could all be as fluent as our parents.  &nbsp;However, this should not be to the detriment of our English, which is the  case with some other Asian communities</p>
       <p>Pavithra  Natarajan:</p>
       <p>Yes, so that  they can communicate with their relatives when they return to Kerala on  holidays.. I know that most of our relatives can speak English perfectly  adequately, but it is different to be take part/understand a conversation in  Malayalam.<br />
       </p>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>
       <p>2. In your  view, is it possible to learn about your &quot;roots&quot; without  understanding the Malayalam language?</p>
       <p><br />
         <strong>PARENTS'  PERSPECTIVE</strong><br />
         P Ramachandran:</p>
       <p>It is possible  to learn about roots by reading relevant books which have been published in  English Language and through discussions with knowledgeable persons who are  willing to share their knowledge.</p>
       <p>G K Nair:</p>
       <p>No.</p>
       <p>Dr P Nair:</p>
       <p>Of course it is  possible. But more importantly it is also possible to be able to speak the  language without knowing the essence of Malayali life. The important factor in  growing up is to be able to develop ones individuality, language in this aspect  is secondary, be it Malayalam or any other language.</p>
       <p>Dr P M Ali:</p>
       <p>If one knows  Malayalam, it may be easy to understand Kerala literature better. Perhaps to  discover our roots, we may have to depend on our heritage. One could get an  idea about ones roots by learning from observation of our parents or elders and  by reading what is available in other language.</p>
       <p>Balasanker:</p>
       <p>Not fully.</p>
       <p>K Natarajan:</p>
       <p>It is possible  to learn about our roots without understanding Malayalam.<br />
       </p>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>
       <p><strong>YOUNG ADULTS'  PERSPECTIVE</strong></p>
       <p>Manoj  Ramachandran:</p>
       <p>It is possible  to learn about the culture and tradition of an area and people, even if one  does not understand the local language.</p>
       <p>Sheela Nair:</p>
       <p>Of course it is  possible to learn about your roots without understanding Malayalam. How many  other cultures do we learn about through school/ reading/ television, without  having to speak their languages? &nbsp;Besides, understanding of a language has  no bearing on your understanding of that culture.</p>
       <p>Geeta  Balasanker:</p>
       <p>Those who learn  about something they have not experienced often make a greater effort to  understand it therefore I think it is possible to learn about our roots without  understanding Malayalam language. &nbsp;We may even learn facts than those who  have grown up in Kerala haven't as we may ask questions that they wouldn't  think of asking. &nbsp;However in some ways our understanding may be limited  such as the understanding of dance and music.</p>
       <p>Pavithra  Natarajan:</p>
       <p>Yes, to a  degree, although understanding Malayalam would of course enhance this  understanding.<br />
       </p>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>
       <p>3.How useful is  Malayalam in your everyday life? &nbsp;Would you rate it as your first, second  or third language?</p>
       <p><strong>PARENTS'  PERSPECTIVE</strong></p>
       <p>P Ramachandran:</p>
       <p>In terms of  usefulness in every day life in Britain, Malayalam has no place.</p>
       <p>G K Nair:</p>
       <p>Mother tongue  is classified as first language which is Malayalam. English and other languages  are a working language.</p>
       <p>Dr P Nair:</p>
       <p>Probably,  third.</p>
       <p>Dr P M Ali:</p>
       <p>In my every day  life, I seldom use Malayalam, except for communicating with other Malayalees.  &nbsp;Here also we often use English. &nbsp;It is easy for me to communicate  with my daughter and son in English. &nbsp;I do not need Malayalam for my  professional life! For my pleasure, I use Malayalam a lot. &nbsp;Without  reading Malayalam poetry I do not think I can spend many days. ONV and Sugatha  Kumari, through their poems fill a vacuum which will not be filled by any thing  else. Malayalam in my case is second language.</p>
       <p>Balasanker:</p>
       <p>Third language.</p>
       <p>K Natarajan:</p>
       <p>In social and  domestic environment it is quite useful. In other environments, it is not of  much use.<br />
       </p>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>
       <p><strong>YOUNG ADULTS'  PERSPECTIVE</strong></p>
       <p>Manoj  Ramachandran:</p>
       <p>Malayalam has  no useful purpose in ones everyday life in this country.</p>
       <p>Sheela Nair:</p>
       <p>Living in  Scotland I was not in touch with any Malayalees bar my family and we usually  communicate in English. &nbsp;So Malayalam probably would be third.</p>
       <p>Geeta  Balasanker:</p>
       <p>Malayalam isn't  particularly useful in my every day life. &nbsp;Most other Asians in this  country speak Gujarati Hindi or Urdu and most Asian 'youth&quot; speak to each  other in English. &nbsp;However I do find Malayalam to be extremely useful when  out shopping with my mother and we don't want people to understand what we are  saying!!!</p>
       <p>Pavithra  Natarajan:</p>
       <p>I would have to  rate it as a 2nd language since my everyday speech is almost completely in  English (except for the daily phone-call home!)<br />
       </p>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>
       <p>4.If the use of  a language is to clearly articulate your needs, feelings and thoughts, does it  matter whether you master Malayalam, English or Greek, provided that you are  highly proficient in the language used in the environment around you?</p>
       <p><strong>PARENTS'  PERSPECTIVE</strong></p>
       <p>P Ramachandran:</p>
       <p>For Life in  Britain, it does not matter if one does not know Malayalam, and in any case  there is no need to master that language.</p>
       <p>G K Nair:</p>
       <p>Yes. &nbsp;Even  the multicultural schools in England are telling parents to teach their  children their mother tongue.</p>
       <p>Dr P Nair:</p>
       <p>Language is the  tool for communication and it is always an advantage to be able to communicate  in more than one language. If Malayalam is the tool used, then it is perfect  for Kerala. &nbsp;But what matters is how one uses his/her language skill to  communicate.</p>
       <p>Dr P M Ali:</p>
       <p>I believe that  it is essential to master the language of the country in which one lives.  &nbsp;Language is for communication and for effective communication, one needs  to master the language of the adopted country.</p>
       <p>Balasanker:</p>
       <p>No.</p>
       <p>K Natarajan:</p>
       <p>Proficiency in  the language used will satisfy the usual/routine needs. However, proficiency in  ones mother tongue will enhance ones articulation of ones feelings and  thoughts, in a much better way. Though I usually forget my dreams when I  wake-up, I think my dreams have always been in Malayalam.<br />
       </p>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>
       <p>4.When you  visit Kerala are you able to communicate with your grandparents and other  family members in a relaxed and fluent manner</p>
       <p><strong>YOUNG ADULTS'  PERSPECTIVE</strong></p>
       <p>Sheela Nair:</p>
       <p>I can  communicate with most of my relatives in Kerala quite happily, though not  always fluently.</p>
       <p>Geeta  Balasanker:</p>
       <p>I find that  many 'young people in Kerala want to prove how good their English is, so even  if you speak to them In Malayalam, they reply in English which makes my life  very easy. When I was younger I wouldn't say much more than “Wenda” or “Mathi”  (I don't know if that is how you spell it) as I was a lot more conscious of how  I sounded, but I do try to make an effort now.</p>
       <p>Pavithra  Natarajan:</p>
       <p>No, I am able  to fully understand a conversation and indeed enjoy listening to my family,  members' banter, but I always wish that I could join in and be an active part  of the conversation, rather than a mere 'observer.<br />
       </p>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>
       <p>5. Indians who  migrated to Mauritius, South Africa, West Indies and Fiji over a hundred years  ago lost touch with their ancestral mother tongue within 3 or 4 generations. Do  you think the same will happen to us?</p>
       <p><strong>PARENTS'  PERSPECTIVE</strong></p>
       <p>P Ramachandran:</p>
       <p>It can happen  that, after three or four generations, descendants of Malayali Immigrants into  Britain may lose touch completely with their ancestral mother tongue. However,  today's world Is far different than what it was even 25 years ago, let alone 50  or 100 years, and faster and cheaper travel and telecommunication, have brought  distant areas and people nearer. Frequent travels back to Kerala and India will  keep values and traditions alive and in the process also enable them to be in  touch with their ancestral language though not necessarily any mastery of the  language. Mastery of the language has no useful purpose anyway from the  standpoint of Life in Britain, as stated in my answer to question 4, although  some one interested in learning more about Malayalam may and can do so for his  own pleasure.</p>
       <p>G K Nair:</p>
       <p>It will not  happen to us provided we encourage our children to follow our suits: &nbsp;For  example Gujaratis they send their children to learn Gujarati in school even  though they are born here. &nbsp;Same with Punjabis and Tamils.</p>
       <p>Dr P Nair:</p>
       <p>I think it is  highly possible. We evolve rather should evolve and adapt to the surroundings.  In our own family of Singapore Malayalees we see the decline of the language  with the third generation. There is no reason to think British Malayalees would  be any different.</p>
       <p>Dr P M Ali:</p>
       <p>I have visited  Mauritius, Fiji, and East Africa where large number of Indians have settled.  &nbsp;In those three countries people still speak the language of the regions  from where they migrated. &nbsp;This is very evident in Fiji and Mauritius .  &nbsp;This could be due to the fad that large number of immigrants settled down  in the same area. &nbsp;So they had the privilege of continuously using the  language of the regions from where they came. In those places there is very  vibrant Indian culture thriving. I happened to read some of the works of  Mauritian writers. &nbsp;They have demonstrated a very great depth of knowledge  of Indian culture.</p>
       <p>Balasanker:</p>
       <p>Yes, because  there is no day to day contact.</p>
       <p>K Natarajan:</p>
       <p>I think the  same thing will happen to us, hut not to the same degree or extent. &nbsp;Owing  to the great advancement in transport and communication, the world today is a  much smaller place, as it were, and hence, we might not lose touch with the our  mother tongue in the way as it happened in Fiji or South Africa.<br />
       </p>
       <p><strong>YOUNG ADULT’S  PERSPECTIVE</strong><br />
         Manoj  Ramachandran:</p>
       <p>After 100  years, it is quite possible that our descendants may lose touch with Malayalam.</p>
       <p>Sheela Nair:</p>
       <p>I think  Malayalees in Britain will be more aware of losing their language and will  probably make more of an effort to maintain its use. &nbsp;Over a hundred year  or so who can tell where the priorities lie.</p>
       <p>Geeta  Balasanker:</p>
       <p>This isn't an  exclusively Indian problem. &nbsp;Ties with the motherland do tend to be lost  as generations pass. &nbsp;Just look at the USA, the population is comprised of  the descendants of people from all over the world, yet in many cases the only  clue as to someone's ethnicity may be their surname. &nbsp;Another reason is  the global dominance of the English language. &nbsp;The world is changing so I  think its something we have to expect.</p>
       <p>Pavithra  Natarajan:</p>
       <p>Yes; anything  not taught to our children dies when we die.<br />
       </p>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>
       <p>6. Many  Malayali parents In Britain blame themselves for not teaching their children the  Malayalam language. &nbsp;If Malayalam classes were available within 10 miles  of your home, would you have attended the course regularly?</p>
       <p><strong>PARENTS'  PERSPECTIVE</strong></p>
       <p>P Ramachandran:</p>
       <p>My children  were not taught Malayalam as they went to Junior Schools in Madras and Bombay.  &nbsp;Not only that, instigated by the teachers of the English medium schools,  the children were encouraged to speak in English at home also. &nbsp;They did  not also need Malayalam, for interaction with other children socially.  &nbsp;They spoke broken Malayalam when they visited Kerala, which was once in  every two or three years. &nbsp;They have been in this country now for fifteen  years, and for life in Britain they have no need of Malayalam. &nbsp;Manoj had  tried to learn Malayalam at home, and can identify the letters and also read  haltingly. &nbsp;Navin cannot read that language. &nbsp;Both however understand  very well when spoken to in Malayalam. &nbsp;I do not blame myself in not  making them master that language.</p>
       <p>G K Nair:</p>
       <p>Yes. At present  in MKA is teaching Malayalam in Southall and Malayalee Association of the UK is  doing the same in East Ham. &nbsp;I don't know about Croydon.</p>
       <p>Dr P M Ali:</p>
       <p>I do not blame  myself for not teaching my daughter and son Malayalam. &nbsp;When I decided to  settle down here, I have accepted that my children may not learn Malayalam.  &nbsp;It does not mean that they do not know Indian culture or they do not  understand Malayalam. &nbsp;I am not sure whether I would have compelled them  to learn Malayalam even if the facilities were available.</p>
       <p>Balasanker:</p>
       <p>Yes.</p>
       <p>K Natarajan:</p>
       <p>As far as I am  concerned, this question now is only of academic interest and the answer would  only be subjective. &nbsp;The answer is “Most probably, Yes”.<br />
       </p>
       <p><strong>YOUNG ADULT’S  PERSPECTIVE</strong></p>
       <p>Manoj  Ramachandran:</p>
       <p>Might have  attended Malayalam classes, if these were available. &nbsp;Audio cassettes and  books will be of real help.</p>
       <p>Sheela Nair:</p>
       <p>Probably not,  as a child my mum would have made me go.</p>
       <p>Geeta  Balasanker:</p>
       <p>That would have  depended if the classes were presented to me as being a fun and interesting  activity, or whether they would have been a chore that I was forced to  participate in. &nbsp;I have got a Malayalam alphabet book at home which I  occasionally like to flick through.</p>
       <p>Pavithra  Natarajan:</p>
       <p>Yes, I would  like to learn Malayalam in a classroom setting, but only if the emphasis was on  learning it for pleasure and conversation without too much work on grammer (and  definitely no exams!)<br />
       </p>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>
       <p>7. There are  many websites containing news items in Malayalam. &nbsp;Should KALA develop a  website to help Malayali children who live in remote areas of the world to  learn the language?</p>
       <p><strong>PARENTS'  PERSPECTIVE</strong></p>
       <p>P Ramachandran:</p>
       <p>I do not think  there is any need for KALA to develop an internet site to help Malayali  children who live in remote areas of the world to learn the language. &nbsp;For  those who are interested in learning the language properly, an audio cassette  with supporting literature, similar to the earning materials available for  French, German, etc would, I think, be more appropriate for remote areas while  interested children in cities could be given access to properly organised  Malayalam classes.</p>
       <p>G K Nair:</p>
       <p>Some people may  not have internet facilities for various reasons. &nbsp;In this case, it is  advisable for these children learning should get a regular photocopied  subjects.</p>
       <p>Dr P Nair:</p>
       <p>I personally  think Kala's responsibility at this stage is towards its member families.  &nbsp;In the future when there is enough commitment from the group, perhaps,  yes. &nbsp;In any case if there are many such Internet sites, we should  probably evaluate them and make recommendations to the group.</p>
       <p>It is great to  learn a language and I personally believe that Malayalam is a great language.  &nbsp;We have a wonderful literature and culture. &nbsp;It will be a great idea  to have a web site for Malayalam sponsored by Kala so that not only Malayali  children also others interested in learning Malayalam could use it.</p>
       <p>Balasanker:</p>
       <p>Yes.</p>
       <p>K Natarajan:</p>
       <p>It will be a  good idea and a great step forward.<br />
         <br />
         <strong>YOUNG ADULT’S  PERSPECTIVE</strong></p>
       <p>7. There are  several internet sites containing news items in Malayalam. &nbsp;Should KALA  develop an internet site to help Malayali children who live in remote areas of  the world to learn the language?</p>
       <p>Manoj  Ramachandran:</p>
       <p>Audio cassettes  and books will be of real help.</p>
       <p>Sheela Nair:</p>
       <p>I don't know if  it should be KALA who set up such a site. &nbsp;But it would be a good idea as  it will no doubt be well received by some and this is how association will grow  after all.</p>
       <p>Geeta  Balasanker:</p>
       <p>Having studied  French, I don't think the best way to learn a language is through a computer.  &nbsp;A variety of resources must be used, hook, audio-visual material, group  activities, and you can’t beat contact with a native speaker. &nbsp;I think  listening to my parents talk to each other has taught me more Malayalam than  any internet site ever could!!</p>
       <p>Pavithra  Natarajan:</p>
       <p>I think that it  would not be easy to learn a language as complex as Malayalam simply over the  internet.</p>
       <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
       <p>That ends the  debate for this issue of The Palm Leaf. &nbsp;In general I thought that the  young adults of KALA understand the importance of Malayalam in communication  but realise the practicalities of Malayalam are limited. &nbsp;The parents  varied in their views, neither always agreeing nor disagreeing with their  children, all the better for the debate!</p>
       <p>Being a young  adult myself, I think that even though I don't use Malayalam at university or  with my friends, I appreciate being able to understand and speak it, when with  relatives and family friends. &nbsp;I think that associations such as KALA have  made the importance of knowing Malayalam even more prominent. &nbsp;I think  that although the youth wing of KALA have grown close, I still believe that the  overall lacking in literary proficiency in Malayalam has made us a separate  group in KAL.A as we don't fully understand the poetry and literature referred  to in KALA meetings. &nbsp;The ability to understand and appreciate the wealth  of literature in our Malayalee culture, are skills that are sadly lacking in  today's generation. &nbsp;With all our scholars on Kerala's rich and vast literature  in KALA alone, surely we can educate our youth so that our heritage and  ancestral mother tongue do not disappear in the generations to come.</p>
       <p>Finally, I  would like to thank all the people who participated in the debate, without your  varied and insightful replies this article would not have been possible.</p>
