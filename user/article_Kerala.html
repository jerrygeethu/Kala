       <p>Medical  students in the UK are supposed to work in a hospital somewhere else as a final  year elective. This may be in a hospital in the UK, but generally, students go abroad.  Sunil chose Trivandrum Medical College and spent eight weeks in Kerala. This is  his account of his experiences there.</p>
       <p><strong>The Hospital</strong><br />
         I started  working in the college in November and completed the elective at the end of  December. The temperature in Trivandrum was 32 C almost throughout the eight  weeks. The hospital and medical college covers a vast area. The entire complex  must be three times bigger than most colleges in the UK. Outside the hospital,  there are always a large number of people. Most just standing around trying to  get passes to enter the hospital. A few just stand around watching what is  going on!</p>
       <p>The inside of  the hospital is completely different from what people in the West expect in  India. I expected to see crowded corridors with rubbish strewn over the floor;  doctors rushing all over the hospital trying to cope with large numbers of  patients; hot and stuffy wards; smells of unkempt utensils and rotting waste.  However most this is not true. Exceptions to this are outside surgery theatres  and outpatients. I expected to have to push through crowds of people to go from  ward to ward, but this wasn't the case.</p>
       <p>Each ward is  probably about twice the size of a ward in a typical London hospital. There are  about 60 beds on each ward. Sometimes, there were too many patients and then  new patients would have to sleep on the floor. The ward isn't normally very hot  due to the presence of ceiling above the beds. Everywhere in the hospital was  neat and clean. In fact, the smell of disinfectant was always quite strong,  especially in the corridors. There are no curtains between beds for privacy.  This could cause problems sometimes, as for example; a suspected HIV case came  onto the ward. Everyone knew that person's problem! However, some patients are  very ill, and not having curtains allows the doctors to keep an eye on all  these patients! </p>
       <p><strong>The Doctors</strong><br />
         On each ward  there are about four or five junior doctors. This comes to about fifteen  patients per doctor. Junior doctors in the UK can have as many as forty  patients per doctor. So it is easy to understand why doctors in Trivandrum are  slightly more relaxed than their counterparts in the UK. However it is not all  easy going for them. Doctors in the UK have a standard five-day week. In  Trivandrum, they work Monday toSaturday every week. Weekend calls are worse,  though, in the UK. A team usually has just the Sunday on-call in Trivandrum,  whereas in most London hospitals, the weekend call starts on Friday and  finishes on Monday morning.There were three students from the UK. Some of the  doctors were friendly to us and willing to help. Others had a short  conversation with us and then never spoke to us again. Apparently, this was  because they couldn't understand our English and so kept their distance. Senior  doctors were normally quite friendly to us and would give us a lot of teaching.  Sometimes professors would compare medicine in India with that in the UK and  ask us what we do in similar situations. They would sometimes spent hours  asking us questions on medicine in London and how our hospitals and teaching  differed.<br />
         <br />
  <strong>The Students</strong><br />
         In Trivandrum,  as well as in London, there are two types or medical students. The first is the  hard-working individual, who always turns up and writes down everything  consultants say. The second type are those who virtually never turn up and if  they do, will stay five minutes just to give party invitation to their friends  on the ward! They are normally in jeans and T-shirts. The group I was with was  supposed to be fourteen in number. I saw ten! The students who turned up at  college were very friendly to say the least.</p>
       <p>A day at  college consists of ward-work and teachings in the mornings, and lectures in  the afternoons. Monday was the big day for us. It consisted of outpatients in  the mornings and the big ward teaching in the afternoon. Outpatients took place  in a room, which was the size of an average living room. Six students and three  doctors would see a patient each, at the same time in this, crowded, room,  However, it is a very quick and efficient system, which in India is very  important. In the UK, outpatients consist of three or four doctors in a room  each, seeing one patient at a lime. An outpatient clinic in my college sees on  average thirty patients in one session. In Trivandrum, there could be at least  double this number.</p>
       <p>The big  afternoon ward teaching was sometimes a torture session for the students. Each  student had to see one of the new admissions and present the case to the  consultant in front of the rest of the group. An example of this was when the  consultant spent one-and-a-half hours asking one student questions and then  making fun of him if he got the answers wrong. In my college we too have one or  two consultants who use the same principles of &quot;teaching by humiliation&quot;.  It is therefore not a surprise that the students in Trivandrum are scared of  their professors.</p>
       <p>Students in  Trivandrum, spend more time studying for medicine than most students in London.  Their knowledge base is therefore very good.</p>
