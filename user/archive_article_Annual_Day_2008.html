       <p><strong><u> </u></strong>KALA Annual Day celebrations honours prize  winners of literary competition for Malayalees in UK</p>
       <p>Kerala Arts and Literary Association  (KALA), celebrated its Annual Day at Parmiter’s School Hall, North   Watford on 18th October, 2008 and honoured the winners of the  first ever literary competition for all UK Malayalees for short story and  poetry held in Malayalam and English. The function was graced by the presence  of chief guest, Sri Kavalam Sreekumar, and guest of honour, Dr M.V. Pillai.</p>
       <p>Sri Kavalam Sreekumar, addressing the  audience, spoke of the presence of music in every one that needed nurturing. He  attempts to make the beauty and complexity of music accessible to the layman by  linking classical to light music became evident when he later he regaled the audience  with virtuoso performances in both genre.</p>
       <p>Dr PKS Nair, the patron of KALA,  presented Dr M.V. Pillai, renowned as a cancer specialist, writer and orator, with  an award in appreciation of his contributions towards Medicine, Arts and Literature.  In a speech, spattered with literary allusions, Dr Pillai, emotionally stated  that his experience of attending the KALA function, was like re-discovering the  seeds of his language and culture, which he  had feared had been lost to the wind over UK three decades ago when he  emigrated to USA, but had seemingly fallen on fertile ground and flourished and  bloomed. Later, responding to a question about second and third generation  losing sight of their hereditary language, he said that the problem was not  with the seed but with the field and organisations like KALA could help prepare  the ground that would nurture growth.</p>
       <p>The prize winning stories and poems of  the literary competition that was organised by KALA were included in KALA's  flagship publication, the Palmleaf. The current issue of the Palmleaf was  released by copies being presented to Sri Kavalam Sreekumar and Dr M.V. Pillai.  Mrs Geetha Menon, the President of KALA, introduced Rajiv Ouseph, current  national champion in Badminton, to the audience as an inspiration to all  Malayalee youth in the UK.</p>
       <p>The evening had a glittering array of  performances from talents within KALA and outside, which included original  compositions for KALA by Professor Madhusoodhanan Nair and Sri Chowalloor  Krishnan Kutty.</p>
