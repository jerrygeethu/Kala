       <p> <em><strong>KALA CELEBRATES 10TH ANNUAL DAY AND HONOURS SRI CHEMMANAM CHACKO</strong></em><br />
       </p>
       <p>Kerala Arts and Literary Association (KALA), UK, celebrated its 10th Annual Day in great style at Parmiter’s Hall, Watford on 21st October 2006. On the occasion KALA honoured Sri Chemmanam Chacko, the eminent Malayalam poet and literary luminary, and appreciated his invaluable contribution to Malayalam literature and poetry. Sri Chacko, in his inimitable, frank style, advised the Malayalee audience on the importance of using Malayalam and teaching their children their mother tongue. He stressed that this was necessary to ensure that the Malayalam language thrived and future generations of Malayalees, born and brought up abroad, would be able to stay in touch with their roots and benefit from the rich cultural heritage of Kerala. In that context, he praised the role played by associations like KALA.</p>
       <p>The landmark celebration of the association had the highly talented and popular music composer and director, Sri M. Jayachandran, as the Chief Guest. Also gracing the occasion as Guest of Honour, along with the Malayalam poet and satirist, Professor Sri Chemmanam Chacko, was the writer, novelist and civil servant, Sri N.S. Madhavan, IAS. </p>
       <p>Mrs. Geetha Menon, President of KALA welcomed the guests and the KALA Patron, Dr. P.K. Sukumaran Nair, introduced the distinguished guests to the audience.  Sri Chemmanam Chacko was especially remembered for the support and encouragement that he had given KALA in its infant years. A lively, post-dinner session that allowed the audience to interact with the eminent guests provided an insight into the life and experiences of these personalities. The evening continued with Sri Jayachandran captivating the audience with his musical genius.</p>
       <p>The pre-dinner session was tightly packed with entertainments ranging from the dance drama titled ‘Devageetha’ by the KALA team and the musical, ‘Sitarist on the Roof’, presented by the KALA youth to classical Bharathanatyam dancing, visual presentation of a socially relevant Malayalam poem and a colourful display of movement and formation by the junior KALA team. The latest issue of KALA’s in-house magazine, Palmleaf, was released by its editor, Dr. Manojkumar, by presenting copies of the magazine to Sri Chemmanam Chacko and the other eminent guests. A sumptuous South Indian dinner rounded off the evening. The KALA Secretary, Mr. Venu Prabhakaran, delivered the vote of thanks.</p>
