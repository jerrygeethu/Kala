       <em>By Viswamitran</em>
       <p> <strong>A hero is an ordinary individual who finds strength to persevere and  endure in spite of overwhelming obstacles.</strong></p>
       <p><strong>Determination in the face  of overwhelming odds</strong></p>
       <p><strong>Determination to succeed  when all seems so desperate and hopeless</strong></p>
       <p><strong>Determination to see hope  instead of hopelessness; to create strength out of weakness; these are  inspirational qualities and inspirational values</strong></p>
       <p>We’ve just seen the dawn of  a new millennium. Every dawn brings an opportunity to leave behind the setbacks  of the previous day and to start fresh. In the same way, the world as a whole,  is entering the new millennium with a sense of optimism and hope. For the first  time in human history, political conquest is showing signs of fatigue. Heroes  of yesteryears were invariably the conquerors who built empires. Alexander the  Great and Akbar the Great have been feted by history as heroes. As Winston  Churchill once said, &quot;Man has conquered everything except himself.&quot;  The one who conquers himself will be the greatest conqueror.</p>
       <p>Gandhiji, a twentieth  century leader, was treated as a hero, not for building an empire, but instead  for helping to dismantle one. His technique, Satyagraha, to most observers, was  just a passive form of resistance, but to Gandhi, it was much more striking, as  it elevated suffering and denial to a formidable weapon in the freedom  struggle. When Gandhiji assumed leadership of the freedom struggle on his  return from South Africa, he was already forty-six and colonial power in India  was still at its prime. He could not have expected to see an independent India  in his lifetime. What Gandhi and his followers achieved in a mere thirty years  that followed would have been unthinkable in 1917 to most realists.</p>
       <p>Another remarkable human  being of our time is Nelson Mandela. In his epic autobiography, &quot;Long Walk  to Freedom&quot;, Mandela describes his early experiences in prison after being  sentenced to hard labour for political activities. He was given, along with  other prisoners, hammers weighing up to fourteen pounds to crush stones into  gravel! During those soul-breaking days, prison warders stared at them like a  collection of rare caged animals. His resolve to rise above the narrow  mindedness of his jailers eventually made them realise that they were dealing  with a man of immense reserves of inner strength. The apartheid regime  attempted to crush his inner resolve in many different ways, including an offer  to release him if he agreed to give up his principles and leave active  politics. He rejected the offer in a open letter to his people saying, &quot;I  cherish my own freedom dearly, but I care even more for your freedom&quot; I  cannot and will not give any undertaking at a time when I and you, the people,  are not free. Your freedom and mine cannot be separated.&quot; &nbsp;Finally,  after a further five years the government realised that they had run out of  options and that their prisoner Mandela held all the cards that will help South  Africa out of its political mess. &nbsp;After nearly thirty years in prison cut  off from the world outside, when he was released, the great man had no malice  towards his warders or to the individuals who led the Apartheid regime.  Mandela, affectionately called Madiba by his followers, is a truly remarkable  man; a man with an inner will that motivated, energised and liberated a whole  nation!</p>
       <p>In his powerful book,  &quot;Still Me&quot;, Christopher Reeve who once portrayed the celluloid hero  Superman, wakes up to the nature of true heroism after he is confined and trapped  as a helpless paraplegic: a hero is an ordinary individual who finds strength  to persevere and endure in spite of overwhelming obstacles. Once merely a  superhero of the celluloid, Reeve has joined the rank of real-life heroes as he  sets an example for paralysed people worldwide.</p>
       <p>Determination in the face  of overwhelming odds. Determination to succeed when all seems so desperate and  hopeless. Determination to see hope instead of hopelessness; to create strength  out of weakness; these are inspirational qualities and inspirational values.</p>
       <p>The most inspirational  teacher I have had is Professor Sumantra Ghoshal, a world class teacher in  transformational leadership who have been a senior professor at Harvard, INSEAD  and London. During one of the several discussions we had in small groups with  Calcutta-born Sumantra, James, a friend of mine and a brilliant TV producer,  said that it is easy to blame the cards one is played in life, not realising  that we are so fortunate. He then added that, it is not the cards obviously,  but how we play them, how we deal with the challenges. How we go forward is  driven by the values and beliefs we breath, automatically, without thinking.  Just like the man in the Peugeot TV advertisement in which a little girl in a  red coat is rescued from an approaching lorry by a dark-suited man acting  selflessly, to the sound track of &quot;Look for the hero inside yourself&quot;  by the music band M.People. Brilliant idea.</p>
       <p>A profile of Yesudas that appears on this site  elsewhere, is another story of human achievement against overwhelming odds. The  values we discussed here are captured in an informercial that appeared in a  magazine recently, &nbsp;&quot;They say there are no heroes any more. But  they’re there. Walk down any street and you will find them. The mothers who  work hard, the fathers who strive, the children who overcome. They aren’t  larger than life, but they are larger than their own lives. Their names aren’t  famous, but their virtues are. Hard work. Common sense. An unshakeable belief  in themselves. If you’re looking for a hero, look around.</p>
