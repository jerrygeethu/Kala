       <span><em>By Prasad Natarajan</em></span>
       <p>Swish, swash,  swish, swash, the wipers tirelessly cleared the windscreen of the pounding  rain. &nbsp;Seemingly effortless, each stroke was mesmerising. &nbsp;No  confusion. &nbsp;No worries. &nbsp;No rights or wrongs. &nbsp;Just up and down.  &nbsp;The shiny black interior of the car portrayed a picture of serene  calmness, contrasting sharply to the turmoil of emotions raging through him.  &nbsp;The knot in his stomach was nearly palpable. &nbsp;His heart had  repositioned itself near his throat while his cold hands gripped the black  steering wheel, the whites of the knuckles showing.</p>
       <p>Racing down the  poorly lit road his mind focused back on the day the whole affair began.  &nbsp;It was in a smoke- filled student union party that he first saw her.  &nbsp;Through the vast hordes of people, he had spotted her simple yet good  looking face. &nbsp;Her long auburn hair cascaded down her bare shoulders.  &nbsp;She had been wearing a black pair of tight fitting Levi jeans coupled  with dark blue Angora top. &nbsp;He had gone over and made the usual  introductions.</p>
       <p>Slowly over  time he had found that more and more he enjoyed her company and she his.  &nbsp;They shared similar interests, had similar friends and it seemed they  were just made for each other. &nbsp;Before long, with seemingly no effort,  they started to go out with each other. &nbsp;Therein lay the root of his  problems. &nbsp;Although he loved every minute he spent with her, fermenting  away in the back of his head was the realisation that ahead of him in the path  of love lay trouble. &nbsp;The rain increased its battering of the car and in  the distance he could hear the low rumbles of thunder. &nbsp;Perhaps, he mused,  a storm was coming in. &nbsp;He swerved the car to the right to avoid a ditch  in the road. &nbsp;Once things were calm again, his pained mind drifted back to  his troubles.</p>
       <p><strong><u><img style="padding:10px;" src="images/article_Behind_the_Steering_Wheel_clip_image002.jpg" alt="wheel" width="230" height="240" align="left" /></u></strong><strong><u>Â </u></strong>The essence of the trouble lay in the fact that  while he was a Hindu, she was a Christian. &nbsp;His parents had had an  arranged marriage and it was assumed that he too would have one.  &nbsp;&nbsp;Yet he was a final year engineering student and was old enough to  decide for himself. &nbsp;Although now everything seemed cosy, in thinking  ahead for the future, he was perturbed. &nbsp;&nbsp;One half said that there  were several positive factors in an interfaith marriage. &nbsp;The positive  aspects of both races could be absorbed and passed on to his young. &nbsp;His  child would get the best of both worlds, a unique and exciting chance to delve  into two old and culturally diverse religions.</p>
       <p>The other half  of his mind said that while in theory all that sounded good, there stood in the  path a great many practical obstacles. &nbsp;He knew that inherent within  everyone was a selfish gene, one that coded for the proteins of self  preservation and perpetuation. &nbsp;He secretly desired for the child to be  brought up as a Hindu, to soak up its values and grow up amongst its rich  cultural heritage. &nbsp;Yet he knew that this was fraught with difficulties.</p>
       <p>A resounding  clap of thunder boomed in the storm raging outside. &nbsp;The electric arc of  lightning for a split second lit up his face, accentuating the haggard furrows  of deep thinking. &nbsp;Just as he wanted for the child, he would want as well.  &nbsp;Next came the problem of language. &nbsp;Not being fully competent in his  own language was a sour point he had always been ashamed of, a fact he had  wished to compensate for by ensuring that his first born would learn it. &nbsp;Yet  he feared and knew that his wife too would have a selfish gene, one that would  want the proteins coded for a British culture. &nbsp;So then what? &nbsp;He was  saved answering this question by a brief flash of lightning followed by a huge  clap of thunder. &nbsp;Despite being warm, he shivered in the proceeding  darkness. </p>
       <p>He doubted that  he would ever find an answer. &nbsp;Intrinsically he knew that he should trust  the wisdom of his deep- rooted culture although his heart advised otherwise.  &nbsp;Should he not trust the evolutionary strength of gut instinct rather than  the swayable heart? &nbsp;With this question pervading the deep recesses of his  mind, he parked the par and stepped out into the rain-filled night.</p>
