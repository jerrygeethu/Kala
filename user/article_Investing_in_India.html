       <em>By T .Haridas Nair and S.N. Nair</em>
       <p>As one of the  largest emerging markets, India offers numerous opportunities for international  ,investors. &nbsp;Furthermore, India offers investors of Indian origin residing  abroad several incentives to invest in this fast growing economy. &nbsp;Through  this column, we intend to serialise a variety of money matters which might be  of some interest to Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) living in the UK. &nbsp;In this  first collection we look at sending money to India, either as a niche for  future holiday trips, or -more seriously - as a large scale saving plan, or  indeed as a source for major property purchase. &nbsp;The often asked questions  and their answers are summarised here.<br />
