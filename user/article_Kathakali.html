       <p>There is not a region, valley or a coast in  India not having its own special folk songs and folk dances. Their themes  revolve around the simple daily tasks - such as harvests, fishing etc. Like  Divali, at times, it is a festival. All the same, certain characteristics are  shared; the way the knees are bent, hips are swayed, moving in rhythmic  circles, clapping to keep timing men, women and children participate, there is  no entertainer... just full entertainment for all! From these emerge the varied  classical dances. The history of Indian art-dances cannot be traced backwards  beyond a few &nbsp;hundred years as Mrs. Gauri Menon finds out...</p>
       <p>In Rig Veda, there is a  description of the dance of Urvasi - a devangana of the Indrasabha.The story  goes that once there lived a handsome and mighty ruler Pururavas, the founder  of the Chandra dynasty He was so famous and good that even Doves admired him.  The divine damsel Urvasi was so overwhelmed by the fame of this mortal king  that while dancing she began muttering his name in the place of Purushothama  (Vishnu). This enraged the great rishi Bharatha. Urvasi was defying the  principles enunciated in his Natya Sastra. &quot;Go down to Earth and live as  the wife of that mortal King&quot;, the rishi cursed. Urvasi spent some years  with Pururavas until Prince Ayus was horn. This story might be a myth, but what  a marvel! The different classical dances in India still adhere to the  principles of the great rishi's Natya Sastra - namely to the division of dance  into Nritha - the pure abstract form, Nrithya dance with mime or rhythm,  Thandava the style followed by men in dance and Lasya, the style for women  dancers For all classical dances musical accompaniments are a must a vocalist,  a percussion instrument player, a cymbal player who also recites the neumonics  and lastly one who follows the vocalist on a stringed instrument such as  violin. Veena is never used as an accompaniment as it is deemed a Deva vadya. </p>
       <p>Five dance  styles are fully accepted as classical or art dances on account of their  sophisticated degree of presentation. They are Bharatha Natyam. Odissi Manipuri  Kathak and Kathakali. Kathakali is undoubtedly the most developed and  sophisticated of all dance dramas in India.</p>
       <p>Kathakali, the  classical dance drama of Kerala, is quite different from the styles of the  other four. In the first place, it is dramatic and not just narrative in  character. Until recently, the dancers were all men. Different characters have  different costumes and make up. Epics or mythological stories are taken as  themes. The puranic characters are portrayed with an unworldly supernatural  grandeur. The characters according to their nature fall into certain distinct  categories.</p>
       <p>Pacha (Green): Famous  rulers on the puranic stories who stood for truth and justice Example: Sree  Rama, Dharmaputhra and King nnnnNala. Peacock feathers adorning The crown is  solely for Krishna.</p>
       <p>Kathi Vesham: Royals having  valour and ferocity. Over the green paint on the lace are streaks of red and  black. Also, a white blob on the nose. To proclaim their cruel nature, at  times, they make hideous sounds Ravana and Duryodhana are examples.<br />
         <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
  &quot;The  large-sized colourful costumes, the elaborate make-up on face with the booming  sound of the Maddalam and Melachenda, and the haunting melody of the songs  transport the audience into a mystical world.&quot; <br />
         &nbsp;<br />
         Chukanna Thadi (Red Beard):  The over-sized red dress, face painted red with black streaks, lips coloured  black and teeth protruding, very huge crown again red and gold on the head. His  form is really scary. &nbsp;Example: Dussasana, the younger brother of  Duryodhana.</p>
       <p>Karutha Thadi (Black  beard): Even the head dress is black, very repulsive. Example: characters like  Kali and certain demons.</p>
       <p>Kari Vesham:  Attired in dirty black clothes with a black conical cap, again an ugly form,  essentially an evil female character.</p>
       <p>Velutha Thadi:  Though gigantic in size, like Red Beard and Black Beard, this is a noble  character unlike the other two. &nbsp;Example: Hanuman.</p>
       <p>Minnukku: Is  the common term or characters representing Saints or Rishis — also good women.  The Saints are clad in white dress. Head is covered with a white cloth for  female characters Women look radiant in their pleated white and gold costume  adorned in traditional jewellery and hair neatly made into a bun on the side.  Characters like Kuchela (men) and Draupadi, Damayanthi or Seetha (women).</p>
       <p>The play begins  with two men holding a colourful satin cloth as a curtain. While the actor  remains partly hidden, one might see the tip of his crown or his fingers as he  too hold the curtain in the middle. In a flash, the curtain is pulled down and  then you see the actor in all his splendour. The naked flame of the traditional  lamp, kalivilakku, enhances the effect of the dancer's facial expressions. The  main vocalist sings keeping thala on chengala while an assistant joins in the  singing with elathala in his hands. Special drums called melachenda and  maddalam are played. The actor demonstrates appropriate hand gestures (mudras)  and expressive muscle movements in the face and eyes. The different phases are  cholliyattam ilakiyattam and kalasam. Students undergo rigorous training for  years to acquire perfection in abhinaya and eye movement. The nine emotions  known as navarasa, a talented dancer expresses easily, bringing each emotion in  his eyes according to the context.</p>
       <p>Kathakali is undoubtedly  the most developed and sophisticated of all dance- dramas in India though plays  like Yakshagana of Mysore do maintain a good standard. It has reached the high  position in the art world due to the selfless service of some very good people  like Vallathol Narayana Menon, the poet, who founded the world-famous Kerala  Kala Mandalam, an institute dedicated to Kathakali and other fine arts. </p>
       <p>The origin of Kathakali is  chequered too. In the ninth century of Malayalam era, one Manavedan Raja of  Kozhikkodu composed Krishnageethi. He was influenced by Jayadeve's Geetha  Govindam. In Geetha Govindam, there are only three characters - Krishna, Radha  and another gopika, Radha's friend. The Raja took the dasamaskanda of Maha  Bhagavatha and dividing it into eight parts told the whole story of Sree  Krishna from avathaaram to swargarohanam.</p>
       <p>This Krishna-geethi became  Krishanattam. One part would be played one night in the temple premises and  devotees would watch without one wink of sleep. It still continues in the  Guruvayoor temple. It did not take long for another gifted writer, the Raja of  Kottarakkara to compose a similar one about Sree Rama. He took Ramayana,  divided it into eight parts and wrote eight plays, called it Ramanattam. The  story is that Manavedan Raja failed to show his work to the Raja of  Kottarakkara. Accepting the challenge, the latter started his Ramanattam.  Ramanattam became very popular, the main reason being while both Geetha  Govindam and Krishnattam are in pure Devanagiri - almost Greek and Latin to the  average individual. Kottarakkara chose the lovely Manipravala language - pure  spoken Malayalam with a smattering of Sanskrit words and people enjoyed it as  they could understand the language.</p>
       <p>It is this  Ramanattam that changed its name to Kathakali. During the last hundred years  many Kathakali plays have been written, techniques and other improvements made  and consequently this art has earned international recognition.</p>
