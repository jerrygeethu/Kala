       <span style="font-size:25px; color:#925c21;"><strong>Vandalism in the Garden</strong></span> <br />
       <em>By Dr. Pat Nair       </em>
       <p>Chop, chop..  dig, dig and plant plant…, the gardening calendar begins in autumn. &nbsp;As  you try to salvage the apples and pears your friends did not take or the birds  did not want, you begin to entertain the idea of vandalism, hold that thought,  this is the time to take your secateurs or even a saw to the withering and sad  looking branches past their prime. &nbsp;Be merciless, think of the  receptionist at the local GP surgery you couldn’t get past to get an appointment,  the job gets easier.<br />
       </p>
       <p>It may hurt you  to chop down the rose bush which gave you immense pleasure all summer. Be sure  to wear gloves. &nbsp;If you had forgotten to feed and water the poor plant and  pour permethrin over it during summer you may consider cutting of the roots and  letting it out of its miserable existence. &nbsp;But do not do this; it is  surprising how forgiving the plants are. Come spring they would have produced  pretty new shoots and it is a new plant all over again. &nbsp;If you are not  aggravated at the time, of course you can delay the chopping till spring for  roses, but you would have wasted valuable nutrients which would have otherwise  been conserved by the plant during the dormant winter period. &nbsp;Do the same  to your beautiful Lavatera with hibiscus like flowers. If you do not have a saw  break the branch with your bear hands- always very satisfying. &nbsp;You can  always repeat the session in spring, but be careful not to chop down plants  which flower on previous year’s growth, such as jasmine or forsythia. &nbsp;End  result is a lushful leafy growth with no flowers.</p>
       <p>This is also  the time to pull out the plants you do not like and redesign your garden.  &nbsp;As for me there not many plants that I would throw out, all have a place  in my garden, except perhaps pampas grass. &nbsp;Even a so called miniature  variety soon overtakes a small garden. &nbsp;Pulling it out takes at least two  people. &nbsp;Enlist the help of your summer guests, tell them how rewarding  the exercise is especially for you. &nbsp;They will stay away for the next few  years!</p>
       <p>Be friends with  designer gardeners. &nbsp;They always redesign their gardens, throwing out what  they do not like. &nbsp;One of my friends is good at this. &nbsp;I have  collected many a specimen from his waste bin, which his wife always saves for  me. &nbsp;They thrive in my garden ever grateful for saving them from the  compost heap. &nbsp;Cheap and efficient way of increasing your stock!  &nbsp;Then there are serious gardeners, they grow plants from seeds and enjoy  sharing them with the less inclined. &nbsp;You do not need to seek them out,  they will find you. </p>
       <p>Creating a  garden from a barren landscape is one of the most satisfying experiences.  &nbsp;When we moved to a new house a few years ago the back garden had plenty  of plants, dandelions, nettles tumbleweed and many of their relatives. &nbsp;We  sighed as the builders rotavated the weeds and the bare red soil glared at us.  &nbsp;Those who drop in on you are suddenly experts, eager to advice you like  those who come to admire a new-born baby. &nbsp;George who came to help us with  digging a hole in the ground to prepare a pond said ‘plant Leylandi along the  fence, it sucks the life out of lesser plants and are worse than a factor 98  sun screen. ‘Dig a trench and fill it with ericaceous compost’ advised another  friend seeing my plants wilt under the shadow of our neighbour’s monstrous  Leylandi. &nbsp;Neither did the alkaline dry soil in the garden nourish the  standard popular plants stocked by garden centres. &nbsp;(weeds thrived  better). &nbsp;Do not heed this well meant advice either, unless your partner  or best friend is an Osteopath. &nbsp;Besides plants follow laws of nature,  they grow where the environment suits them. &nbsp;If you have alkaline soil  choose lime loving plants, do not waste money on Rhododendrons, camellias,  acers (beautiful though they are in acid soil) or alstromera species.  &nbsp;There are several varieties of Clematis you will enjoy, hebes are not  fussy and poppy’s and meconopsis will run riot in an alkaline garden.  &nbsp;Plants in its natural habitat thrive like Jeremy Clarkson trying out a  new model of Mercedes. &nbsp;Unnatural environment, and the plant is like the  same man on a two wheeler.</p>
       <p>Autumn is also  the time to plant bulbs for spring and for planting shrubs. &nbsp;Daffodils and  Tulips, lilies if you can get them, (remember there are lime loving and lime  hating varieties). &nbsp;Dig deep before planting. I am usually very grateful  to my colleagues when it comes to planting. I think of the most obnoxious NHS  manager or consultant, and the effect in spring is fantastic.</p>
       <p>Shrubs have the  whole autumn to get used to your garden, by spring they would have established  their roots. &nbsp;Remember to water a newly planted shrub every day, if you  want a thriving specimen for summer. &nbsp;The first year of its tiny life in  your garden determines its stature just like the feeding in first year  determines the size of a baby’s fat cells and its future obesity.</p>
