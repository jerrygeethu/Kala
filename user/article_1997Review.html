       <em>Prashant Nair reviews a translation of Matampu Kunjukuttan's highly acclaimed novel, "Brushtu"   </em>
       <p><strong><u> </u></strong>Over a period  of time I decided to read the English translation of the Malayalam novel  &quot;BRUSHTU&quot; or OUTCASTE.</p>
       <p>It is a  true-life story about one woman who decided to try and stop the evil ritual  (which was equivalent to excommunication) that was practised against the  Namboodiri women who happened to stray away from the restrictions imposed by  their community. &nbsp;The Namboodiri men had freedom to do whatever they  wanted. &nbsp;This used to happen a long time ago.</p>
       <p>Some of you may  recall the talk by Dr. Jancy James about women of Kerala in our last annual  meeting. &nbsp;Against that background it is interesting to note that although  there were recognition for women's contributions in the society of the time,  women in the high caste community had to suffer due to such bad practices like  Bhrushtu.</p>
       <p>In the present  story one particular woman Paptikutty had rebelled and suffered for it.  &nbsp;The Namboodiri men took her to court, where she announced that if she  were to be outcasted then her lovers would also have to be outcasted, as they  were equally guilty. &nbsp;Eventually the court had to accept her argument and  for the first time the men had also been punished. &nbsp;I understand that the  Namboodiri community, like other communities of Kerala has since reformed, and  the Namboodiri women enjoy better rights.</p>
       <p>This book also  gives the reader insights to what life would have been like with the  Namboodiris way of life. &nbsp;I would recommend the reader to read the book a  little at a time because the beginning can be a little difficult to understand.  &nbsp;It is only half-way through the book that the main story begins. &nbsp;It  is a good book for any mature reader, especially Malayalees, because this is  what happened a long time ago, in short, it is fact of our heritage.</p>
       <p>The author of  this book Matampu Shankaran Kunjukuttan was born in 1921 in Kiraloor, Kerala.  &nbsp;He had a traditional upbringing, steeped in Sanskrit and Vedic recitals,  and for a while he taught at Sanskrit school at Kodungallur. &nbsp;He has  written 8 novels, some of which have won national awards and been made into  films.</p>
       <p>The translator  Vasanti Shankara Narayanan was born in 1936 and holds a PhD in cinema. &nbsp;In  the introduction Shankara Narayanan says “It is not merely a novel, but a  detailed portrayal it represents. &nbsp;Above all, it is a moving piece on the  human predicament — tragedy and comedy, pleasure and pain, strength and  weakness, love and detachment.”</p>
