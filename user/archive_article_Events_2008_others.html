       <p><strong><u> </u></strong><strong>KALA  Celebrates 11th Annual Day</strong></p>
       <p>In every sense the  celebration of the 11th Annual Day of Kerala Arts and Literary  Association (KALA) UK  on 20th October 2007 was a truly remarkable and enriching experience  that lingered for days in one’s mind. The event was held at the Parmiter’s  School Auditorium in Watford. The occasion was  graced by the Chief Guest Prof. Vishnu Narayanan Nambudiri, Guests of Honour  Dr. George Gheverghese Joseph, Professor of Mathematics and author, Civic  Ambassador and Chairperson of Newham, Mrs. Omana Gangadharan, the Kathakali artiste,  Shri Kottakkal Sasidharan Nair, and the corporate entertainer, Shri Praveen Chulliparambil.  On this occasion KALA honoured Prof Vishnu Narayanan Nambudiri by presenting  him with the Life Time Achievement Award in recognition of his commendable  contribution to Indian poetry, Vedic wisdom and heritage. The award was  presented by KALA Patron, Dr. P. Sukumaran Nair in the presence of KALA  President Mrs. Geetha Menon and other distinguished guests.</p>
       <p>The Annual Day  celebrations brought out much more than the usual splendour of artistic  programmes through a unique musical presentation of poetry and dance and  thought provoking and humorous sketches and skits. The Chief Guest, Prof.  Vishnu Nambudiri, pointed out that the occasion provided a meeting ground for  many eminent persons who had nurtured a wish for many years to meet the other  personalities. Dr. George Gheverghese Joseph, the author of &quot;The Crest of  the Peacock: non-European Roots of Mathematics&quot; and many other  publications spoke of the great contributions that Kerala had made to  mathematics several centuries ago, which has not been recognised by the western  countries. Civic Ambassador Mrs. Omana Gangadharan spoke of her great  satisfaction at being able to meet the eminent chief guest and other guests,  and wished all success to KALA in its activities. </p>
       <p>As far as entertainments  went, there was a fabulous line up of programmes starting with a tableau titled  “Incredible India”, ably performed by very young performers of KALA, colourfully  depicting India’s  diverse culture. This was followed by an impressive dance medley ‘East meets  West’ choreographed and presented by the Youth members of KALA. KALA also paid  tribute to the work of the late author and poet, Padmasree Dr. Ayyappa Paniker.  Solo and well-remembered songs sung by Mrs. Susha Ashok Kumar and Praveen  Gopinath added a hint of nostalgia to the evening.</p>
       <p>The powerful and enchanting  Kathakali presentation, “Krishnakatha”, by Shri Kottakkal Sasidhran Nair through  the exquisite combination of <em>Aangikam, Mudra, Abhiynayam, Sabdam and  Sangeetam</em> had the audience spellbound. The highlight of the evening was the  dance drama, “Muthiyum Chozhiyum”, based on the poem by Padmasree ONV Kurup. It  was a unique presentation, bringing to life an old rural folk art once common  in some of Kerala’s villages and involving the participation of very talented KALA  members. Dr. Mayadevi Kurup choreographed the dance drama.</p>
       <p>The post-dinner programmes  also caught the interest of the audience. A fusion of instrumental music with  Manoj Siva on the tabla and Hari on the violin, with Dr. Sethumadhavan  providing vocal support, created a magical experience for the audience. ‘Mukhamukham’  with Prof. Vishnu Narayanan Nambudiri and Dr. George Joseph was an occasion for  sharing their insights and experiences with the audience. Dr. Manoj Kumar,  Editor of KALA’s in-house magazine, the Palmleaf, handed the first copy of the  Annual issue to Prof. Vishnu Narayanan Nambudiri who presented it to the Civic  Ambassador, Mrs. Omana Gangadharan, for its release. The variety of this year’s  entertainment did not end there - Mr. Praveen Chulliparambil captured the  attention of both young and old alike with his show ‘The Sixth Sense’, by weaving  a magical concoction of mentalism and illusion.      <br />

         <strong>KALA Sportsfest –  December 2008</strong></p>
       <p>As promised, KALA  took steps to chase away the winter blues by holding a Sportsfest on 9th  December 2007 at the Ferry Sports Centre in Oxford. The activities and games for the day  were ably organised by Dr Jose Mathews. Along with a good turn out of both  participants for the various activities and friends to cheer the competitors  on, the event proved to be a great success. The younger kids showed their  competitive streak in events such as lime and spoon race and sack race and also  found enjoyment releasing their energy on a bouncy castle. After several rounds  of men’s and women’s badminton, the men’s champions and the winning women’s  pair were declared. This was followed by an energetic game of 5-a-side football  with three men’s teams and a very competitive ladies basketball match with 4  teams. After the strenuous efforts of the afternoon, replenishment in the form  of Jose and Simmy’s home-made pizzas pushed fresh life into one and all. The  winners this year were:</p>

           <strong>KALA Literary Evening  – May 2008  </strong></p>
       <p>For more than six  years KALA has been hosting a literary event that has provided a forum to its  members and guests alike to share and discuss the delights of books that they  have come across. This year was no different. A sumptuous feast of words was  hosted and co-ordinated by Mr Natarajan at KALA’s Literary Evening on Saturday  10th of May 2008 at the Heatherside Community Hall, Heatherside,  Camberley. As always, the evening included an outstanding group of speakers,  both young and old, speaking in Malayalam and English on a wide variety of  books. What was a good evening became even a better one with time at the end  for discussion and socialising. </p>
       <p>Interspersed with  anecdotes and literary facts relating to the various presentations, the event’s  host, Mr Natarajan, ably introduced KALA’s fine line-up of speakers and bards.  Two books - ‘The Inheritance of Loss’, the Booker prize winner of 2006 and ‘Q  &amp; A’ by Vikas Swarup, the book riding the heights of popular fiction - were  introduced by Mr Ramachandran. Comparisons were made between the two books in  relation to the time that went into the writing of each book and the way in  which each was crafted. Sangeetha Venugopal’s preferred choice was Khalid  Hosseini’s ‘The Kite Runner’, a book that was too good to put down and which  provided a fascinating insight into the history of Afghanistan from the time of the  Russian invasion. This year also saw several new faces at the podium – Dr Arun  Kishore, who touched on the art of story-telling through linear narration and <em>fabula</em>, highlighted the works of  numerous writers in English who have roots in Kerala. From amongst this list of  prolific Malayalee writers, he singled out Anitha Nair and her recent  achievement, ‘Mistress’ for a brief review. Mr Rajeev’s presentation of Wendy  Moore’s well-researched and biographical work, ‘The Knife Man’ recounted the  tale of the father of modern surgery, John Hunter. The book journeys back to a  time of crude and old-fashioned medical practices that makes one appreciate the  modern times we live in today.</p>
       <p>Although not  newcomers to the event, there was much focus on the speakers that brought  variety to the programme. Mr. Manoj Siva’s forceful presentation of two short  stories written in Malayalam and authored by him was heartfelt and moving. The  first titled ‘Ayyappana njaannaaru?’ is a reflection of the perpetual quest for  one’s identity and the second is a variation to the myth of Ahalya, told in  Manoj’s inimitable style. Dr. Mohanachandran’s sonorous recital of Edasseri’s  ‘Poothapaattu’, forty odd years after he first recited it in the company of  Edasseri’s son, gave the poem a life of its own and immense beauty. Mr Jagan  took a different tack altogether and chose to speak about a subject close to  his heart that was based on current issues and an offshoot of modern society –  the effects of increased use of plastic on the environment. He left us with a  very strong and clear message to reuse and recycle plastic bags, and our  responsibility for saving the environment.</p>
       <p>As always, KALA’s  youth put on a tremendous performance, reviewing a wide-range of titles. Eight  year old Manasi’s clear and confident recital of Robert Louis Stevenson’s poem,  ‘My Shadow’ held the audience spellbound. George Orwell’s well-known work, ‘The  Animal Farm’, took new meaning for Shiva Krishna as it became evident that the  story drew parallels from the Russian Revolution of 1917. Dahlin Mony’s  favourite read was Robert Muchamore’s ‘Mad Dogs’, a story revolving around gang  wars and espionage. Brother, Damien Mony, on the other hand, was into the  vampire series by author Darren Shan and chose to review his book, ‘Cirque Du  Freak’. Whitbread Award winner Hilary Mckay’s book, Saffy’s Angel’ was Pavna  Venugopal’s choice for its simple and elegant tale of Saffron and her siblings.  Anoop Jagan chose to speak about Willis Hall’s play ‘The Long and the Short and  The Tall’, which follows the tale of seven British soldiers in the Malayan jungle  during the Second World War. Except for Shiva, all the others were making their  first appearance at the event.</p>
       <p>Mr Natarajan took a  few minutes to pay tribute to the poet, Shri Kadammanitta, by the rendition of one  of his earlier poems. Through the various passages in Gandhiji’s ‘My  Experiments with Truth’, Mr Narayanan Pillai stressed the need for Gandhian  thought and ideals in today’s hectic lifestyle. Mrs Santha Krishnamurthy’s  rendition of her poem titled ‘Onam’ held sweet and nostalgic memories of an  Onam celebrated in India.  Mrs Gowri Bai took the opportunity to speak about the changes to the Malayalam  poetry scene over the years. Her impromptu and melodious recitations of verses  from well-known poems brought across the beauty and differences in the writings  of the great Malayalee poets. In an age when time does not stand still and  communication is mainly through emails and phone calls, Mr Hrishi Marar’s  presentation of Kalidasa’s epic work ‘Meghasandesam’ beautifully describes  sublime and imaginative ways of communicating with one’s beloved during a time  of separation. With the recitation of a modern poem by Shri Madhusoodhanan Nair  titled ‘<em>Aathame, Samsyayam, Krishna</em>’,  Dr Sukumaran Nair conveyed the need to face all hardships in life with fortitude  and a smile as Shri Krishna was known to have done.</p>
       <p>It was a very  memorable evening with a lot being said that gave much stimulation to the  brain. KALA’s Literary evening highlighted the gift of words and even more so  the joy of sharing it with others.<br />

       <p><strong>KALA Summer Walk –  July 2008</strong></p>
       <p>We  barely had a summer this year and therefore it took KALA a certain amount of  organisation and plenty of luck with the weather to have its annual summer  outing without being rained on! The day out was on held on 19th July  2008 at Cassiobury Park in Watford, which was picked after much hunting around  by Preethi and Shankar for an ideal spot. Although the day started on a gloomy  note, the rain clouds were soon whisked away and all those who got together  ended up enjoying glorious weather, wonderful company and delicious food. The  day’s activities took the form of quiet strolls around the park in little  groups, watching the canal boats negotiating locks, playing football and  cricket on the green, a quick snooze in the shade of a tree, enjoying a game of  dumb charades and singing to one’s heart’s content in competition! The  youngsters also had a go in the paddling pools and mini train circuit, and  dabbled with paints to get their impression of the day out on paper. Now we  wait in anticipation for next summer and a good weather day for KALA’s summer  walk....</p>
       <p><strong>KALA Gopi Memorial  Cricket – August 2008</strong></p>
       Once again on Bank Holiday  Sunday on 24th August 2008, the Bishop’s Stotford College  ground in Bishop Stotford was the venue for the KALA Gopi Memorial Cricket  match. KALA was able to organise another successful event this year too with  help from Shashi, Preethi, Ravi and Praveen,  who once again organised facilities at the beautiful grounds at Bishops  Stortford and all those who attended and helped prepare a wonderful  'Onasadya'.&nbsp;With a slightly later start than planned due to inclement  weather, the tournament progressed with an air of enthusiasm and  competitiveness, the youth team determined to win the match this year. The adult  team batted first and set the target of 134 runs in 30 overs. The youth team  took up the challenge and played strategically. In a thrilling and exciting  second half the youth team reached the required target losing 7 wickets and went  on to win the rolling trophy. The winning run was scored by Damian, who  remained not out along with the team captain, Praveen. Tanoj, who opened the  innings for the adult team took 46 runs and was declared 'Man of the Match'. The  'Champagne/Chocolate Moment' was presented to young Damian. The men’s cricket was  followed by a ladies match with a lot of enthusiasm. Renu Radhakrishnan's team  won this match and Thankam Ramachandran was declared 'Woman of the Match'.<br />
