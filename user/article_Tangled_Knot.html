       <em>Review of Hanif Kureshi's novel 'The Black Album' by Anita Nair      </em>
       <p><strong><u> </u></strong>The novel  follows the life of a young man named Shahid, who moves from the outskirts to  an inner-city London area, and encounters a turbulent ride through a world of  religion, racism, drugs and love <br />
 <br />
Divisions of  nationality, regardless of the country you live in, can be identified through  ethnic, religious and cultural class lines. &nbsp;As a result of multicultural  societies, racism and conflict has grown between ethnic groups. &nbsp;Hanif  Kureshi's ‘The Black Album’ is a novel that is set against a backdrop of social  issues that are linked to race, religion and culture.</p>
       <p>Kureshi was  born in 1955, in the white suburban area of Bromley, Kent. &nbsp;His dad was  Gujarathi, Muslim, and thus living on the outskirts of south London, i.e.  National Front areas such as Lewisham, he was prone to racist abuse. &nbsp;In  the early 70s he had his first experience of racism following Enoch Powell's  speech on immigration on 20th April 1968; 'like the Romans, I seem to see the  River Tibet flowing with much blood'. &nbsp;He felt like an outsider. &nbsp;In  1980 he began writing for the Royal Court theatre. &nbsp;His first essay was,  'The Rainbow Sign but he got his big break in 1984 with, My Beautiful  Laundrette; criticising Thatcherite culture. &nbsp;In 1987 he wrote, Sammy and  Rosie Get Laid reflecting the plight of the Inner-city areas, it was criticised  as betraying English heritage of films. &nbsp;Thus his work can be seen to be  politically enforced as well as ensuring controversy. &nbsp;His book, ‘Buddha  Of Suburbia’, was written in 1990, for which he won the Whitbread Prize for  best first novel, which was later adapted for television.</p>
       <p>'The Black  Album’, was published in 1994 but was set in 1989. &nbsp;The Black Album was  seen to explore, possibilities and effects of a search for freedom and personal  liberty. &nbsp;Essentially, the novel follows the life of a young man named  Shahid, who moves from the outskirts to an inner-city London area, and  encounters a turbulent ride through a world of religion, racism, drugs and  love. &nbsp;It explores areas of art and literature and portrays fundamentalism  as amoral, i.e. the burning of books.</p>
       <p>The book  conveys messages of religion, politics, education, sexuality, love and leisure.  &nbsp;Race, culture and religion dominate the novel and they arguably can be  considered as being one and the same. &nbsp;Colonisation and inter-racial  mixing mean that there are no simple racial distinctive groups justify.  &nbsp;Physical and cultural differences however, are the basis for social  definitions of ethnic difference. &nbsp;In ethnic groups shared culture is  usually linked to national and religious identity. &nbsp;The belief of ethnic  inferiority is an ethnocentric perception, traced back to imperialism and  colonial rule, in an effort to justify their conquests and exploitation of  other social groups.</p>
       <p>Even though the  times when Kureshi grew up were liberating, tension still resided for the  blacks and the Asians in all sections of society. &nbsp;Kureshi presents race  in its extreme forms, he contrasts the white middle class, western image of  Didi, with the fundamentalist working class image of Riaz and his militant  group and Chili's representation of a 'high classed businessman', wearing a  slick grey suit. &nbsp;His 'crocodile shoes’, is flawed by the fad that he  lives off drug money, is a womaniser and also an alcohol and drug abuser.  &nbsp;Hence, in comparison especially to the group, Shahid and Didi remain to  be the only pragmatic characters represented with little defects.  &nbsp;However, in pursuing the immoral love of his married teacher, Shahid is  eventually outcast as a spy by Riaz's group and Didi chastised as an evil  influence. &nbsp;This highlights the issue of race and interracial  relationships. &nbsp;Ironically, Riaz's cult are fighting for equality In a  multicultural society, however it is their narrow-mindedness which ignites the  issue of racism.</p>
       <p>Religion is  used as a form of security for Shahid, in order to fit into society. &nbsp;It  is this acceptance which he sought, later entrapped him. &nbsp;As he learnt  more about the group, his feeling of dislocation grew. &nbsp;Religion was not  firmly instilled in Shahid and his older brother Chili by their materialistic  ‘papa’, when they were young, enjoying drinking and eating ham, considered  taboo in the Muslim religion. &nbsp;When the religious enthusiasm is so strong  it envelopes every aspect of life. &nbsp;This is reflected in the words of  Shahid to Didi, “I want to follow rules”, and when she questions, “even if they  are foolish?”, he replies, “there must be a reason for them. &nbsp;Those rules  have been followed by millions of people for hundreds or years”. &nbsp;It can  henceforth be seen that in their strive for freedom, they limit themselves of  free thinking, causing the whole race to act in a fanatical, brainwashed  manner. &nbsp;The scene of the burning of the book, presumed to be Salmon  Rushdie's ‘The Satanic Verses’, by Riaz's gang highlights their fanatic,  ignorance and blind faith. &nbsp;When queried, ‘did you read the book?’, no one  could reply. &nbsp;Thus their anger is simply aroused because the book attacks  established ways of the Muslim community. &nbsp;However, when the reasoning  voice of Shahid asks, ‘Isn't the individual voice important?’ the reply from  Riaz is, 'The importance of faith is deeper than the ravings of one  individual's imagination'. &nbsp;Zulma, Chili's wife, cannot stand their lack  of freedom within the community, warning Shahid that, ‘Religion is for the  benefit of the masses’.</p>
       <p>Benefits of  religion are also conveyed between Shahid and Didi's dialogue, Didi states  ‘alcohol is one of the great pleasures’, where Shahid retorts, 'Is life just  for pleasures?'. &nbsp;Thus religion can be seen as part of the cultural  system, giving meaning to life, answering mans questions about himself and the  world he lives in. &nbsp;Through Riaz and followers we witness the formation of  religious cults. &nbsp;These sects and cults are not a new phenomenon and have  existed for centuries. &nbsp;Despite this, most existing sects and cults  originated in the twentieth century and the 1960's saw the appearance of many  new organisations. &nbsp;The growth of sects and cults can be explained either  in terms of why particular individuals choose to join or in terms of wider  social changes. &nbsp;In reality these reasons are closely linked, for social  changes affect the number of people available as potential recruits.</p>
       <p>Culture  primarily concerns the way in which we understand and relate to social  situations. &nbsp;The issue of culture is articulated in many ways throughout,  ‘The Black Album’. &nbsp;We are able to witness this in terms of leisure, and  the euphoria of clubs and hence drug culture. &nbsp;We witness this the first  time Shahid and Didi go out. &nbsp;It seems to fulfil a need for escapism for  Didi, i.e. her marriage to Brownlow, and for Shahid in his need for acceptance.  &nbsp;This issue parallels that of religion, i.e. the mental ecstasy of drugs  contrasted with that of praying or meditation, as it too serves as a form of  escapism and acceptance, for Shahid at least. &nbsp;Gender and sexuality  provides an issue of exploitation (it is not clear of who) unconventional  gender culture and need for acceptance, i.e., Shahid, Didi and her husband.  &nbsp;When Didi questions what Shahid's friends think of her, he replies, 'they  don't discuss women, they just respect them'. &nbsp;Zulma personifies the image  of a ‘good Muslim wife’, beautiful, talented, obedient to her father-in-law and  husband.</p>
       <p>The continual  theme of the novel is the culture of education. &nbsp;It is through Shahid's  pursuit of this, that the novel achieves its pinnacle, forming a  'bildungsroman' technique, i.e., a coming of age novel. &nbsp;Through this, the  reader along with Shahid attains an understanding of his allegorical journey  towards self knowledge. &nbsp;Individual characterisations all represent forces  of the wider world in terms of race, politics and history. &nbsp;Racial  feelings of culture run high within the novel, thus English is used little in  conversation between the group, preferring their mother tongue of Urdu.  &nbsp;Unlike Shahid, Riaz, could never consider England as his home believing,  'If we absorb western morals, it makes us individualistic', thus meaning that  he would be too self concerned and unable to fight for his people. &nbsp;Even  Zulma, Shahid's sister-in-law remarks, 'when we are westernised, families bust  up and we become like everyone else'. &nbsp;Family unity is depicted as an  important part of Asian culture, i.e., Zulma advises Shahid, to get back home and  dedicate himself to helping their aged mother in running the family business.</p>
       <p>It is indeed  surprising how a sense of dedication and service can go with blind  superstition. &nbsp;'The Black<em>'</em></p>
