       <em>Some afterthoughts</em>
       <p><strong><u> </u></strong><em>After listening  to the various views raised at the Vayalar symposium, Murali and Omana Nair  join the discussion with their observation.</em><br />
Â <br />
Even viewed  from our limited knowledge of Malayalam literature in general and the subject  in particular, the symposium was a great success, as it was an occasion for us  to know more about Vayalar and the socio-political landscape in Kerala at the  time. &nbsp;We also felt that everyone else enjoyed the event, and would have  gone on enjoying, for more than one reason, had there been more time.</p>
       <p>The symposium  was not merely about the great Vayalar - it was also about sharing feelings and  emotions which are so personal - that normally one would have shared them with  close friends or relations. &nbsp;Obviously the subject proved to be a common  thread through which deep personal experiences of many individuals could be  linked; perhaps because some of them had unfortunate tragic personal losses at  very vulnerable stages in their lives, similar to those shared by the great  poet or the characters in his masterpieces. &nbsp;The discussions touched very  many hearts present there. &nbsp;Or is this an understatement?</p>
       <p>One doubt lingers  in our minds - whether the speakers really meant that Vayalar was a poet who  effectively used the medium of cinema to commercialise his poetry and gain  popularity. &nbsp;In our opinion it is not fair to attribute such motives.</p>
       <p>Firstly, a true  creative artist or author does not give much attention to the commercial aspect  of his art (except, of course, those commissioned to produce work in the West).  &nbsp;A piece of art or literature is an original work, which could be liked  and appreciated by more people than some other pieces of work at a given time,  which makes one more popular than the other, so long as there is not another  better piece of work which proves to be more attractive to the popular mind.  &nbsp;Normally, the creator does not and cannot plan how his work would be  received, absorbed and appreciated by the audience, as there are so many  factors that could influence the result. &nbsp;So he could not pursue a  commercial motive.</p>
       <p>Secondly,  sadly, the true worth of many an artist is more often recognised much after  their effective working life. &nbsp;Consequently they do not receive the credit  (or the so called commercial benefits), and most of them remain paupers, a  factor which encourages many artists to sacrifice their artistic talents on the  altar of livelihood, and compels them to seek other avenues for sustenance in a  commercialised world. &nbsp;Vayalar could have done better in life by pursuing  some other branch of scholastic career, which he had denied himself due to his  commitment to art, regardless of materialistic outcome. &nbsp;That was true  love of art. &nbsp;Some elements in society at that time would have exploited  it (e.g. cinema producers) with a commercial angle, for which the artist should  not bear the responsibility. &nbsp;A test would prove this point - who get more  recognition for a particular song - the actor, singer or writer? &nbsp;How many  people could easily recall who sang the song or who wrote it? &nbsp;Again this  should be seen through the lenses of the mass population and not the  intelligent or the upper echelons of society to get a true picture. &nbsp;This  is more probable when the subject is associated with socialist ideals!</p>
