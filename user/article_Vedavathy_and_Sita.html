     <div class="contactDiv1" ><span style="font-size:25px; color:#925c21;"><strong>The story of Vedavathy and Sita Onam</strong></span> <br />
       <span><em>“…He expected  to meet a Rishi but to his amazement the occupant was a lovely young damsel,  clad in deer skin with matted hair. &nbsp;She was in mediation. &nbsp;The  brilliance emanating from the young lady nearly blinded him. &nbsp;Her  exquisite loveliness seemed to be glowing. &nbsp;Ravana was enthralled.  &nbsp;Waking up from her mediation she opened her beautiful eyes and saw  Ravana. &nbsp;Never had he seen such loveliness.” &nbsp;Mrs. Gauri Menon  narrates a story from the great epics.</em></span>
       <p>Ravana, the  king of the Rakshasas, was one day travelling in his aeroplane, Pushpaka  Vimana, and looking down. &nbsp;He was captivated by the sight of the glorious  forests. &nbsp;He landed in a comfortable valley to enjoy a closer view.  &nbsp;At that moment he was buoyant with joy and pride. &nbsp;He had just finished  his long, arduous penance and, god Siva pleased with his devotion, appeared  before him and gave him the great weapon - Chandrahasa. </p>
       <p>To his  surprise, Ravana saw a hermitage close by. &nbsp;He expected to meet a Rishi  but to his amazement the occupant was a lovely young damsel, clad in deer sin  with matted hair. &nbsp;She was in mediation. &nbsp;The brilliance emanating  from the young lady nearly blinded him. &nbsp;Her exquisite loveliness seemed  to be glowing. &nbsp;Ravana was enthralled. &nbsp;Waking up from her meditation  she opened her beautiful eyes and saw Ravana. &nbsp;Never had he seen such  loveliness. &nbsp;&quot;There is no lovelier maiden who would not bow to you,  O, best of ladies, how come you are wasting your youth in this way? &nbsp;You  should be in all luxury! &nbsp;Whose daughter are you? &nbsp;Are you Urvasi? Or  are you Menaka?&quot; Ravana said feeling it should surely be a celestial  beauty.</p>
       <p>With a gentle  serene smile the maiden answered &quot;Devaguru Brihaspathi is my grandfather  and I am the daughter of his son Rishi Kusadwaja. &nbsp;Both my father and  grandfather being well versed in Veda, I have been given the name Vedavathy.  &nbsp;Many suitors came for my hand, but my father had his mind only the  lotus-eyed Madhava as his son-in-law. &nbsp;To fulfill my father’s wish I  decided to do penance and please Madhava. &nbsp;The suitors were all so angry  with my father at his decision and killed him. &nbsp;&nbsp;My mother soon died  of grief. &nbsp;So you see that I am still at my penance.</p>
       <p>&quot;O,  Ravana, I have heard of your might-also have you achieved great power by  praying to Siva. &nbsp;I wish you well. &nbsp;&nbsp;Now may you please go your  way.&quot;</p>
       <p>Ravana was so  captivated by her beauty that he had other thoughts, being a Rakshasa.  &nbsp;&nbsp;Getting down from his Pushpaka Vimana, he went near her and said  &quot;No, my love, the Vishnu you are praying to is inferior to me in power, I  assure you. &nbsp;No I cannot allow you to waste your youth and loveliness  thinking of him.&quot; &nbsp;&quot;Stop uttering unholy words in my  presence&quot;, Vedavathy responded in all dignity. &nbsp;Ravana had just one  thought. Make Vedavathy his queen, by force if needed. &nbsp;In a flash he  grabbed her long flowing matted hair. &nbsp;Shivering with rage she raised her  hand and ... it turned into a sword. &nbsp;With that she cut her lovely hair.  &nbsp;&quot;No, I do not want to live in this body contaminated by your touch.  I am destroying it in fire right now. I am going to be a new- born infant girl  in my next birth in a field. &nbsp;A king will discover me and bring up as his  daughter. From that moment O, Ravana, I assure you your tragedy begins.  &nbsp;Not only you but your whole family will perish&quot;. &nbsp;With these  words Vedavathy, the lovely maiden burnt herself to ashes in her Yaga Mahagni  (holy fire). From the sky Devas threw celestial flowers all around the place.  Ravana stood dazed.</p>
       <p>Vedavathy  returned to earth as Sita, daughter of king Janaka. &nbsp;She was obtained in  the Yaga vedi from the tip of a plough (Sita) and hence came to be known as  Sita and was brought up as the princess of Mithila dynasty</p>
       <p>The rest of the story is  known to everyone. &nbsp;Sita married Lord Rama. &nbsp;Not only Ravana but also  his whole family was destroyed through Sita, Vedavathy’s curse getting  fulfilled thus.</p>
