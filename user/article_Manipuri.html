       <p>After  introducing us to the intricacies of Kathakali, Bharata Natyam and Mohini Attam  in the last three issues of the Palm Leaf, Mrs Gauri Menon now takes us to  Eastern India.<br />
       </p>
       <p><strong>Manipuri</strong></p>
       <p>Manipuri is a  lyrical dance form hailing from the eastern regions of India. &nbsp;The origin  is attributed to the vision of a king. &nbsp;In the sequestered land of Manipur  surrounded by the Naga hills, there lived a Naga king in the 15th century who  following a vision planned to propitiate the divine power and improve the lot  of his subjects. &nbsp;What started as a folk dance changed into ritual and  ceremonial dances as years rolled by. &nbsp;Later as a result of the interaction  of several highly developed forms of ritual and religious dances and the  Vaishnava cult, dances known as Rasa dance evolved giving predominance to the  incidents in Shri Krishna Leela. &nbsp;This was in the 19th century. Unlike  other Indian classical dances, facial expressions and abhinaya are totally  absent but the dancers with their serpentine movements depict the sun, the  moon, the stars or flowers in the form of dance patterns. &nbsp;Though the  trend is Lasya, there is Thandava aspect as well when the male dancers perform  the war-like rituals.<img style="padding:10px;" src="images/article_Manipuri_clip_image002.jpg" alt="manipuri" width="174" height="204" align="left" /><br />
         <br />
         The major  portion of the repertoire comprise five different types of ballets revolving  round the theme of Radha, Krishna and Gopikas. &nbsp;The other groups of  classical dances come under the title Sankeertanas performed generally by men.  &nbsp;Typical Manipur drums (Pung) or cymbals (kartals) and or clapping help to  keep the rhythm (thala). &nbsp;A variety of intricate rhythmic patterns are  prayed on the drum and the cymbals. </p>
       <p>In technique,  Manipuri is distinct from other classical types. &nbsp;Feet are in front not  out-turned, knees are relaxed though slightly bent forward - never flexed  sideways, no out-turned positions of the thighs either. &nbsp;The whole body is  turned into an imaginary figure of light with the upper chest and waist moving  in opposition. &nbsp;The arms move as one unit - no sharp angles through elbow  bending. &nbsp;The fingers move in circles, semicircles or curves folding and  unfolding gradually.</p>
       <p>The primary  unit of movement is known as chali or the pareng on which the dance is built.  &nbsp;In a programme the Nata Sankeerta generally precede the Rasa &nbsp;There  are vigorous masculine techniques involving jumps and elevations.</p>
       <p>Priests and  priestesses perform special ritual dances in front of village deities  culminating in trances. &nbsp;Maiba and Maibee are the names of such ritual  types. &nbsp;Then there are ritual dances spreading over several days when it  is known as Lai Haroda. &nbsp;Here the pattern is vigorous and of varying  sections - the movements being performed to a repetitive melody on a bowed  instrument - the Pana. &nbsp;The main dances are Khamba Thoibi - supposedly  counterparts of Siva and Parvathi. &nbsp;Expressions are placid - that and the  characteristic movements of the fingers suggest a closeness to South East Asian  dance styles such as Balinese and Thai.<br />
         <br />
  <strong>Odissi</strong><br />
  <img src="images/article_Manipuri_clip_image004.jpg" alt="odissi" width="135" height="204" align="right" />Developed from the musical pray Sangeetha Nataka and  the dances of gymnasiums known as the Akharas, Odissi is a close parallel to  Bharata Natyam. Sculptural evidence relating to the style of dancing goes to  2nd century B.C., it is claimed. &nbsp;But inscriptions, manuscripts and other  records speak of the prevalence of dance styles based on rituals of temples and  entertainments of the village squares from 12th century onwards. &nbsp;The  celebrated poetic work of the 12th century Gita Govinda dominated the musical  content of the dance style.</p>
       <p>In the early  years, this dance was performed by women known as Maharis in the temple of  Jagannath. &nbsp;Later, one hears of Gotipuas - men dressed as women performing  these dances in the courtyards of temples. &nbsp;Odissi in its present form as  a solo dance evolved out of air these - being revived once again during the  last two decades.<br />
       </p>
       <p>Its  technique is built around a basic motif in which the human body assumes the  thrice deflected posture known as Tribhanga, reminiscent of ancient  sculptures... waist and chest moving in counter or opposite ways. &nbsp;The  repertoire comprises numbers built on pure Nrita design recalling the lovely  sculptural poses carved in the Orissan temples. &nbsp;The poses are strung  together within several meterical cycles or Thalas. &nbsp;The unit of movement  is Arasa as distinct from Adavu of Bharata Natyam. &nbsp;At the outset there is  an invocation to Ganesha ... the God who removes all obstacles... verses of the  Gita Govinda and Oriya poetry providing the musical background. &nbsp;The  dancer has scope to improvise within the Tala in the dance patterns. &nbsp;A  talented dancer interprets the poetic line in a variety of ways to evolve a  single mood, Samjukta Panigrahi is a great exponent of this classical style. </p>
