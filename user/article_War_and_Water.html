       <span><em>A parable by Kamala Harihara Aiyar</em></span>
       <p>“Kadai sollu  Attungal Patti, Kadai sollu.” &nbsp;&nbsp;We all (kids) gather around our  beloved grandmother (Patti in Tamil and Muthassi in Malayalam). &nbsp;This  loveable soul, in fact, was my great grandmother and she hailed from Attungal  near Trivandrum. &nbsp;Hence the prefix to her status. &nbsp;Initially she will  make some lame excuses as being tired or wanting to chant her prayers.  &nbsp;But she will relent in the end.</p>
       <p>All her stories  had a moral to learn. &nbsp;Life looked charming and peaceful listening to  these anecdotes. &nbsp;&nbsp;Some may have been true. &nbsp;Others mythical but  absorbing and fascinating. &nbsp;Here is an excellent story laden with wisdom  not only for quarrelsome couples but also to siblings who bicker and argue even  for trifling matters.</p>
       <p>In the bygone  days couples were bound to matrimonial vows 'for better or worse.' &nbsp;They  had to give credence to the pledge and work it out. &nbsp;The question of  divorce was unacceptable. &nbsp;From today's perspective they make look like  draconian measures. &nbsp;Yet these customs had good family values. &nbsp;All  worked hard to prevent families from splintering on trivial issues. &nbsp;A Lot  of effort went in to settle family disputes as much as possible by elders and  caring friends.</p>
       <p>Long ago there  lived a quarrelsome couple. &nbsp;Their incessant bickering made the man feel  undervalued and the woman unappreciated. &nbsp;This led to more trouble.  &nbsp;Any counselling or advice went down the drain. &nbsp;The problem got  worse each day.</p>
       <p>The wife was  labelled ‘quarrel-monger’, the husband as ‘henpecked and impotent’.  &nbsp;Should he not control a verbose woman? &nbsp;Relations and neighbours  tried to intervene to kick in some sense and understanding. &nbsp;&nbsp;No  luck.</p>
       <p>One day, the  sudden arrival of a holy man in town excited the community. &nbsp;They flocked  to his congregation and received benediction. &nbsp;Many vouchsafed his healing  powers with utter conviction.</p>
       <p>A well-wisher  sought guidance from this holy man for the redemption of the miserable warring  couple.</p>
       <p>After realising  the nature of the couple's marital problem, the holy man went into deep  meditation. &nbsp;He then chanted mantras keeping his hands cupped over a  tumbler of water. &nbsp;A smirky grin was flashing on his kind face on and  often.</p>
       <p>An hour later  he opened his eyes and gave the sanctified water to the intermediary.  &nbsp;“This water will solve the problem. &nbsp;I have full faith in its  healing power”, he said. &nbsp;“Give this to the woman. (The man escaped  censure!) &nbsp;My instructions are to be followed meticulously. &nbsp;Results  are guaranteed.”</p>
       <p>The holy water,  with detailed instruction of its use, was delivered to the wife. &nbsp;She  faithfully followed the instructions. &nbsp;As if by magic, peace and  tranquillity returned to the household. &nbsp;The husband was amazed at his  wife's quite demeanour. &nbsp;“Why isn't she provoking me any more?”, he  pondered. &nbsp;She wondered why he has not been daunting her lately.  &nbsp;Needless to say, the couple began to love each other again.  &nbsp;Everyone attributed this to the competence of the holy Seer!</p>
       <p>Little did the  twosome, or anybody for that matter, how the holy water worked. &nbsp;The  well-wisher had said, “the Seer wants you to hold a spoonful of this  consecrated water in your mouth every morning. &nbsp;Don't swallow.  &nbsp;&nbsp;Spit out after your husband has gone to work. &nbsp;&nbsp;In the  evening, before his return, the holy water should be in your mouth until dinner  time. &nbsp;Follow this assiduously for a month for positive results.&quot;</p>
       <p>No research was  conducted to prove that the water in the mouth shut one up. &nbsp;Don't we need  two hands to clap and make noise?</p>
       <p>My  grandmother's above story (or was it yarn) helped me in good stead for a stable  married life. &nbsp;Should I add that for a successful marriage or  long-standing relationship give and take policies are of paramount importance?  When did ego pay?</p>
