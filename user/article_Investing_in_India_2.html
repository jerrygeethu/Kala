       <em>T.Haridas Nair and S.N. Nair presents a compilation of questions and answers about Indian regulations applicable to NRI investments</em>
       <p><em><strong>Q: What is the  Portfolio Investment Scheme?</strong></em><br />
A: Under this  scheme, NRIs are permitted to acquire shares/ debentures of Indian companies  through the stock exchange in India.</p>
       <p><em><strong>Q: What is the  procedure for making applications?</strong></em><br />
         A: The  application is to be submitted to Reserve Bank through a designated branch of a  bank in India in a prescribed form.</p>
       <p><em><strong>Q: What is a  designated branch?</strong></em><br />
         A: Reserve Bank  has authorised a few branches of each bank to conduct the business under  Portfolio Investment Scheme on behalf of NRIs. &nbsp;These branches are the  main branches of major commercial banks located close to the stock exchanges.  &nbsp;NRIs will have to route their applications through any of the designated  bank branches who have authorisation from Reserve Bank.</p>
       <p><strong><em>Q: Can a NRI  can apply through more than one designated Branch?</em></strong><br />
         A: No.  &nbsp;Each NRI has to select one branch for this purpose for investment on  repatriation/non-repatriation basis.</p>
       <p><strong><em>Q: Is it  necessary to maintain a bank account with the designated Branch through whom  the application is made?</em></strong><br />
         A: It is  advisable to maintain bank account with the designated branch for  administrative convenience.</p>
       <p><strong><em>Q: What is the  validity period of Reserve Bank approval for the purchase of shares and  debentures?</em></strong><br />
         A: Reserve Rank  approval is valid for a period of five years from the date of issue. &nbsp;This  can be renewed future by making a request by means of a simple letter.</p>
       <p><em><strong>Q: Is there any  ceiling on the Investment under the Portfolio Investment Scheme?</strong></em><br />
         A: These is an  overall ceiling of 5% of paid up share capital of the company/paid up value of  each series of convertible debentures for purchase by NRIs/OCBs. &nbsp;The  overall ceiling can be raised to 24% if the company concerned passes a  resolution to that effect in its general body meeting. &nbsp;Individually, NRIs  / OCBs can make investment upto 1% of the paid-up share capital/each series of  convertible debentures.</p>
       <p><strong><em>Q: Is there any  lock-in period for investment made under the scheme?</em></strong><br />
         A: Yes.  &nbsp;There is lock-in period of one year for investment made on repatriation  basis. &nbsp;The period of one year is reckoned from the date of registration  of the shares. &nbsp;However, for investment made on non- repatriation basis,  there is no lock-in period.</p>
       <p><em><strong>Q: As an NRI, I  understand that I am eligible for import of gold/silver to India. &nbsp;I would  like to sell the gold so imported. &nbsp;Kindly advise me the tax implications.</strong></em><br />
         A: Reserve Bank  has permitted NRIs to legally import gold (maximum 5 kgs, duty of Rs 220 per  l0gms) and silver (100 kgs per passenger, duty of Rs 500 per kg) once in six  months. &nbsp;Many NRIs are under the mistaken belief that if the imported  gold/silver is sold in India, it is exempted from tax. &nbsp;No. &nbsp;This is  not true. &nbsp;When you sell the precious metal in India, and earn profit, it  is liable to Indian income tax. &nbsp;The profit is liable to tax as business  income or capital gains. &nbsp;It depends on your intention. &nbsp;If your  intention is to take advantage of the business opportunity as sell the precious  metal, it would be treated as business profit. &nbsp;If your intention is to  hold it as a capital asset, it would be treated as capital gains.</p>
       <p>Most NRIs take  advantage of the business opportunity and buy the precious metal before coming  to India and sell it soon. &nbsp;In such circumstances, it will be treated as a  business income. &nbsp;From the sale proceeds, the cost and expenses incurred  for the sale can be deducted. &nbsp;Tax will be payable at the normal  applicable rates. &nbsp;If you have acquired the gold as a capital asset,  income will be treated as short term or long term depending upon your period of  holding. &nbsp;If you hold it for less than 3 years, it will be short term.  &nbsp;Tax at normal rates have to be paid. &nbsp;If you hold it for more than 3  years, the capital gains will be long term and you can get some tax benefits. &nbsp;Tax  will be payable at the rate of 20% only on the capital gains, after taking the  benefit of cost and expenses.</p>
       <p>The Q&amp;A  provided here are for information purposes and they do not constitute  investment advice. &nbsp;Government legislation in this field in updated on a  regular basis. &nbsp;Investors should check with an appropriate agency for up  to date information before making major decisions.</p>
