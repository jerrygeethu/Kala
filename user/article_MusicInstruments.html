       <em>Vincent Mavely argues persuasively that children should be encouraged to learn to play musical instruments for fun and as part of their all-round development.</em>

       <p>&nbsp;</p>
       <p>&quot;After all, to achieve something in life,  everyone has to work hard.&nbsp;We know of athletes and dancers who spend  several hours a day, aiming for perfection. &nbsp;Learning a musical instrument  is no different. &nbsp;Hard work and hours of practice will, in the end, not  only achieve excellent results but also a lot of pleasure and  satisfaction.&quot; </p>
       <p>Indians have music as  second nature, we all will agree. &nbsp;We all like listening, to the latest  hit songs and invest some money in the latest Hi -Fi or CD system. &nbsp;That  is our tradition. &nbsp;Have not our kings and Maharajas employed residents  artists and musicians to entertain not only the members of their household, but  also the public even at considerable expenses and detriment to other economic  projects?</p>
       <p>The very objective of  starting “KALA” was to encourage the hidden artistic talents in members and  their children. &nbsp;In this respect, we have to learn a lot from our Tamil  friends, who are very eager and insist that at least one child in their family  should learn a musical instrument. &nbsp;It is a sad fact even after the second  generation in the western world that we Malayalees do not have many youngsters  who have mastered any musical instrument. &nbsp;The reasons of course are  various.</p>
       <p>Many children, while at  school, start to learn piano, flute or guitar. &nbsp;Is this because they have  the talent or just because their friends at school have these classes and they  want to join them? &nbsp;It is all right if they carry on and achieve something.  &nbsp;But very often they lose their interest after a while and abandon the  lessons. &nbsp;All efforts and money spent in vain!</p>
       <p>We parents therefore should  be able to detect any talent in our children and encourage them to persist in  learning a skill. &nbsp;We must point out to them that, in this country to  succeed in any field, half-skill is not sufficient. &nbsp;Unless you are a  genius, you have to be hard working and extremely clever to be able to compete  with others. &nbsp;This is the same as taking any A level exam. &nbsp;Again, it  is a good idea. to make children interested in a rare music instrument than  letting them start piano or guitar. &nbsp;While watching concerts on TV, ask  them among the hundreds of instruments, which one would they like to learn?  &nbsp;For a change a special instrument say cello, trumpet or saxophone,  mastering which would have a better opportunity to join a group and get  involved in music. &nbsp;Paying for these lessons would be good investment and  money well spent.</p>
        
       <p>Lastly, bear in mind that children change their  taste and views very quickly and easily influenced by the media. &nbsp;A child  who had shown interest in Piano at an early stage may like Guitar after some  time. &nbsp;So, the decision taken to learn a particular instrument at an early  stage has to be. maintained in order to achieve the result. &nbsp;Abandoning a  skill at half way through is surely an unwise decision. &nbsp;After all to  achieve something in life, everyone has to work hard. &nbsp;We know of  athletes, musicians and dancers who spend several hours a day, aiming for  perfection. &nbsp;Learning a musical instrument is not different. &nbsp;You can  expect hard work and needs hours of practice which will in the end not only  achieve excellent results but also lot of pleasure and satisfaction. &nbsp;It  is the same as getting a degree in medicine or accountancy. &nbsp;So if  thinking of learning an instrument, make a proper decision: only hard work,  patience and perseverance will get you there!</p>
