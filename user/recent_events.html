      <p>We as Keralites, are the custodians of a rich,   vibrant and colourful cultural heritage. This heritage spans various   fields ranging from art to architecture, language to literature, and,   martial arts to music. We have the moral duty to hand over that heritage   to the next generation on behalf of the one hundred generations that   came and went before our time. The question now is, while being an   active part of the British society, how much of the heritage can be   handed over to future generations and in what form.</p>
      <p><br />
        When
        the words came to an end, the evening took off in the direction of feeding the hungry with the most tastefully prepared dosas and chutneys, organised by Baburaj and Rajee. We now have to wait out another year for another event of this kind. </p>
      <p>In this respect, there is no point in pretending   to be half-pregnant and argue either way according to the   occasion. No one can deny the power of the past in shaping the future.   At the same time, there is no point in thinking like a general who is   preparing to win the last war he lost. Let us be pragmatic about it. No   one can realistically expect the second generation Keralites in the UK   to live exactly like the first generation. Time has moved on. Each   generation has its own hopes and aspirations. Let us look to the future.</p>
      <p>So what are the elements of Kerala   culture we wish to hand over to the future generations? It has been an   accepted fact that the moral values and virtues of the Eastern society -   humanity, propriety, faithfulness and wisdom - re-inforces   the inner strength of human mind. This is an area the Western society   has come to accept the intellectual superiority of Eastern philosophies.   On a more practical level, these values define our day-to-day   relationships - parent and child, husband and wife and, friend and   friend.</p>
      <p>How do we generate awareness of these   ethics in the next generation? It is obvious that bombarding the   youngsters with advice will be counter-productive. Only if they   learn these values themselves, they will have a commitment to applying   them in their lives. How will they learn these valves themselves? The   role of environment and peer-groups becomes significant; the   ability to understand Indian art and literature becomes important; the   ability to read the language, Malayalam, becomes a necessity.</p>
      <p>We present the first issue of The Palm   Leaf before you in the hope that you will see it as a channel to discuss   and debate these issues. We also hope that we will collectively be able   to overcome the historical Indian weakness, of debating about   everything under the sun without paying much attention to turning ideas   into practical actions.</p>
      <p><em>Dr. Viswamitran, Editor, The Palmleaf   (1996-2000)</em></p>
